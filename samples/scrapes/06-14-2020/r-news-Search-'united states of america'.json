Happy to do this! - MrGandW\n\n**Out of room - Part 5 is [HERE!](http://redd.it/205k0i)**\n\nThere seems to be a crowdsourced map hunt for the flight going on [Tomnod.](http://www.tomnod.com/nod/challenge/malaysiaairsar2014)\n\n[CURRENT SEARCH AREA](http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/73498000/jpg/_73498637_china_malaysia_plane4_624.jpg) - BBC\n\nMYT is GMT/UTC + 8.\n\nKeep in mind that there are lots of stories going around right now, and the updates you see here are posted only after I've verified them with reputable news sources. For example, stories about phones ringing are because of the phones going to voicemail or call forwarding - they are not actually the passengers' phones themselves ringing. To my knowledge, none of the passengers' phones have been reported as active or responsive.\n\n**UPDATE 5:21 PM UTC**: White House Press Secretary says NTSB, FAA officials have arrived in Malaysia; still not enough information to know cause of plane's disappearance.\n\n**UPDATE 4:06 PM UTC**: China to adjust search for missing Malaysia Airlines flight over expanded range and involve more ships in rescue work, state news agency says. [Source](https://twitter.com/XHNews)\n\n**THIRTEENTH MEDIA STATEMENT, 11:30 PM MYT/3:30 PM UTC**: In response to [these allegations:](http://aca.ninemsn.com.au/article/8812646/woman-raises-questions-about-cockpit-behaviour)\n\n>Malaysia Airlines has become aware of the allegations being made against First Officer, Fariq Ab Hamid which we take very seriously. We are shocked by these allegations.\n\n>We have not been able to confirm the validity of the pictures and videos of the alleged incident. As you are aware, we are in the midst of a crisis, and we do not want our attention to be diverted.\n\n>We also urge the media and general public to respect the privacy of the families of our colleagues and passengers. It has been a difficult time for them.\n\n>The welfare of both the crew and passenger\u2019s families remain our focus. At the same time, the security and safety of our passengers is of the utmost importance to us.\n\n**UPDATE 1:03 PM UTC**: Relatives of Chinese passengers on board missing the flight have refused to accept money from Malaysia Airlines as distrust and frustration at the carrier mounted, AFP reports.\nThe airline said it had offered \u201cfinancial assistance\u201d of 31,000 yuan (\u00a33,040) to the family of each missing traveller.\nBut a relative of one of the passengers, from east China\u2019s Shandong province, told AFP: \u201cWe\u2019re not really interested in the money.\u201d \n\n**UPDATE 10:35 AM UTC**: Interpol has revealed the names of two Iranians who boarded flight MH370 on the stolen passports.Interpol\u2019s chief Ronald Noble named one as Pouri Nour Mohammadi who was born on 30 April 1995. The other was Delavar Syed Mohammad Reza born 21 September 1984.\nHe later added that he was inclined to thing the disappearance of the plane was not a terrorist incident. [The Guardian](http://www.theguardian.com/world/blog/2014/mar/11/malaysia-airlines-mh370-search-refocused-on-malacca-straits-live-updates#block-531ee41ce4b025518d900a60)\n\n**UPDATE 10:24 AM UTC**: Malaysia's military believes it tracked missing plane on radar to Strait of Malacca, military source says. Reuters.\n\n**TWELFTH MEDIA STATEMENT, 5:29 PM MYT/9:29 AM UTC**:\n\n> This statement is in reference to the many queries on the alleged five (5) passengers who checked-in but did not board MH370 on 8 March 2014 from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing despite having valid tickets to travel.\n\n> Malaysia Airlines wishes to clarify that there were four (4) passengers who had valid booking to travel on flight MH370, 8 March 2014, but did not show up to check-in for the flight.\n\n> As such, the issue of off-loading unaccompanied baggage did not arise, as the said four passengers did not check in for the flight. Hence, the above claim is untrue.\n\n**03:00 pm MYT / 07:00 am GMT - PRESS CONFERENCE**\n\n* No confirmation of any findings of debris\n* Passenger using stolen Austrian passport has been identified as 19 year old Iranian, Pouria Nour Mohammad Mehdad. He's a asylum seeker heading to Frankfurt to see his mother. It's \"not likely\" they were involved with terrorist organisation.\n* Investigation is ongoing for the passenger using stolen Italian passport. CCTV image.\n* Malaysian police confirms there was no passenger that did not board the flight (in contrary of the previous 5 missing passenger, as told by DCA)\n* Malaysian police is investigating a range of theories including hijacking and sabotage, but also any possible psychological problems of those on board.\n\n**UPDATE 5:06 AM UTC**: China is pushing insurers to quickly settle claims in missing Malaysian plane case. [Source](http://www.scmp.com/business/china-business/article/1445691/china-pushing-insurers-quickly-settle-claims-malaysian-plane)\n\n**UPDATE 4:01 AM UTC**: CNN reporters, citing the Hong Kong Civil Aviation Dept., say Cathay Pacific Airways pilots have spotted 'large solid debris.' Previous reports about debris have been confirmed false. [Source](https://twitter.com/vplus/status/443231550524899328)\n\n**ELEVENTH MEDIA STATEMENT, 11:15 AM MYT/3:15 AM UTC**:\n\n>As we enter into Day 4, the aircraft is yet to be found. \n\n>The search and rescue teams have expanded the scope beyond the flight path. The focus now is on the West Peninsular of Malaysia at the Straits of Malacca. The authorities are looking at a possibility of an attempt made by MH370 to turn back to Subang. All angles are being looked at. We are not ruling out any possibilities.\n\n>The last known position of MH370 before it disappeared off the radar was 065515 North (longitude) and 1033443 East (latitude).\n\n>The mission is aided by various countries namely Australia, China, Thailand, Indonesia, Singapore, Vietnam, Philippines and the United States of America. The assets deployed to cover the search and rescue is expensive. In total there are nine aircraft and 24 vessels deployed on this mission.\n\n>Apart from the search in the sea, search on land in between these areas is also conducted.\n\n>The search and rescue teams have analysed debris and oil slick found in the waters. It is confirmed that it does not belong to MH370.\n\n>The B777-200 aircraft that operated MH370 underwent maintenance 10 days before this particular flight on 6 March 2014.

What is a novel coronavirus?**\n\n> A coronavirus is actually the name for a set of illnesses, including the common cold and other respiratory infections. A novel coronavirus means it\u2019s a new virus that originated in animals, but has jumped to humans. This particular 2019 novel coronavirus from Wuhan is called COVID-19 or 2019-nCoV.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**How does the COVID-19 spread?**\n\n> This virus is really transmissible and can spread easily from person to person even before a person develops symptoms. It\u2019s carried on respiratory droplets when we talk, sneeze, and cough and these can land on surfaces or in someone\u2019s mouth or nose.  When it comes to respiratory droplets, 6 feet is the magic distance. That\u2019s how far these tiny, infected droplets can travel.  Being within 6 feet of someone who is sick can get you or your personal space contaminated with COVID-19.  \n\n> When droplets land on surfaces, we can pick them up with our hands and transfer them to our eyes, mouth, and nose when we touch our faces. This is why hand hygiene is so important.  Respiratory secretions (like snot and sputum) are also infectious so cover your coughs and sneezes.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**What are the symptoms of the virus? Is it deadly?** \n\n> It typically causes flu-like symptoms. Some patients \u2014 particularly the elderly and others with other chronic health conditions \u2014 develop a severe form of pneumonia.\n\n> Patients develop symptoms like fever, muscle and body aches, cough, and sore throat about 5-6 days after infection. Most people will feel pretty miserable for a week and get better on their own.  Some people won\u2019t get as sick, but it\u2019s still important not to be out and about, so as not to spread the disease.  A minority of patients will get worse instead of better. This usually happens after 5-7 days of illness and these patients will have more shortness of breath and worsening cough.  If this happens, it\u2019s time to contact your doctor again or even go to an emergency room. Be sure to call first so they know you are coming.  \n\n> The numbers of people who have been diagnosed and how many have died are changing daily. As of early March, there have been over 97,000 confirmed cases, with a death toll of about 3,000 (more than 2,900 in mainland China). But these numbers are just estimates; it\u2019s still unclear how many people have actually been infected worldwide. Most of the deaths have been in adults over 60 years old who had other health concerns.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Are we all at risk for catching this new coronavirus (2019-nCoV)?**\n\n> Yes. It doesn\u2019t appear anyone is naturally immune to this particular virus and there\u2019s no reason to believe anybody has antibodies that would normally protect them. \n\n> The lack of previous experience with this pathogen is part of the reason why public health officials around the globe are working so hard to contain the spread of this particular coronavirus from Wuhan. When viruses come out like this that are both new (which means the population is highly susceptible) and can easily pass from person to person (a high transmission rate), they can be really dangerous \u2014 even if here\u2019s a low percentage of people who die from them. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Why do some people with the COVID-19 get sicker than others?**\n\n> It looks like only about 20% of people who contract this novel coronavirus need to be hospitalized. The other 80% get what feels like a bad cold and recover at home. A lot of this has to do with underlying medical conditions. People who are more vulnerable to any kind of infection \u2014 because of their age or chronic health conditions \u2014 are more at risk for getting really sick from COVID-19. \n\n> That said, some otherwise healthy people do seem to be getting sicker from this infection than we would expect. We don\u2019t understand why that is or what might be different about these patients. If you have COVID-19 and you are getting sicker and sicker instead of better and better, you should contact your doctor or visit an ER. Be sure to call first so they know to expect you.  \n\n&nbsp;\n\n**What kind of medical care do patients with COVID-19 need?**\n\n> About 80% of people who contract this new coronavirus will feel sick, but ultimately be just fine. It\u2019s the 20% of COVID-19 patients who get really, really sick that worry many of us in the infectious diseases field. A lot of these critically ill patients wind up needing to be hospitalized for their pneumonia-like illnesses. They typically require critical care and ventilation \u2014 special machines that help them breathe. And some need to stay on ventilators for weeks at a time. It\u2019s this portion of patients that is most concerning. Depending on how many cases develop here in the U.S., providing that level of care for so many people over a number of weeks runs the risk of overwhelming the nation\u2019s health care system pretty quickly. We can help prevent this kind of \u201csurge\u201d in patients by practicing social distancing (see below for more explanation). \n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Should people be more concerned about the seasonal flu or COVID-19?**\n \n> There\u2019s widespread seasonal flu activity going on right now all around the U.S.  But there are steps you can take to protect yourself from influenza. You can get an annual flu shot. You can take medication like Tamiflu that protects you from getting influenza after you\u2019ve been exposed. You can cover your mouth and wash your hands to mitigate the spread. And, like clockwork, this year\u2019s influenza strain is going to die out in the spring because it will have run its course. \n\n> The challenge with COVID-19 is that we probably can\u2019t contain it and we don\u2019t know if we\u2019re really prepared as a country for a massive coronavirus epidemic.  If we are lucky, it will slow down a bit over the summer but the next few months look like they are going to be pretty tough for all of us. We need to be as ready as we can for whatever comes our way and know that we will get through it eventually. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n**How can I protect myself?  Should I wear a facemask?**\n  \n> Take the preventive actions you do for the cold and flu. This includes avoiding close contact with people who are sick; not touching your eyes, nose and mouth; washing your hands thoroughly and frequently; and cleaning and disinfecting objects and surfaces you come in contact with regularly.\n\n> The CDC does not recommend you wear a facemask to protect yourself from getting COVID-19 or other respiratory illnesses. Those who have COVID-19 and/or are showing symptoms should wear a mask to protect others from getting the virus.  Any healthcare worker taking care of someone infected with COVID-19 also should wear a mask.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Can I take an antibiotic or vaccinate against the virus?**\n \n> There is no antibiotic (they are designed for bacterial infections, not viral ones) to treat COVID-19.  Scientists are already working on a vaccine, but we don\u2019t expect to have a good vaccine until spring of 2021 at the earliest.  However, ongoing trials in China suggest that there are some existing antiviral drugs that may be helpful for the sickest patients.  In fact, the University of Chicago is part of a multi-institutional team that has mapped a protein of SARS-CoV-2 and found drugs previously in development for SARS could be effective for COVID-19.\n\n> For now, doctors can only treat the symptoms, not the virus itself."

What is a novel coronavirus?**\n\n> A coronavirus is actually the name for a set of illnesses, including the common cold and other respiratory infections. A novel coronavirus means it\u2019s a new virus that originated in animals, but has jumped to humans. This particular 2019 novel coronavirus from Wuhan is called COVID-19 or 2019-nCoV.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**How does the COVID-19 spread?**\n\n> This virus is really transmissible and can spread easily from person to person even before a person develops symptoms. It\u2019s carried on respiratory droplets when we talk, sneeze, and cough and these can land on surfaces or in someone\u2019s mouth or nose.  When it comes to respiratory droplets, 6 feet is the magic distance. That\u2019s how far these tiny, infected droplets can travel.  Being within 6 feet of someone who is sick can get you or your personal space contaminated with COVID-19.  \n\n> When droplets land on surfaces, we can pick them up with our hands and transfer them to our eyes, mouth, and nose when we touch our faces. This is why hand hygiene is so important.  Respiratory secretions (like snot and sputum) are also infectious so cover your coughs and sneezes.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**What are the symptoms of the virus? Is it deadly?** \n\n> It typically causes flu-like symptoms. Some patients \u2014 particularly the elderly and others with other chronic health conditions \u2014 develop a severe form of pneumonia.\n\n> Patients develop symptoms like fever, muscle and body aches, cough, and sore throat about 5-6 days after infection. Most people will feel pretty miserable for a week and get better on their own.  Some people won\u2019t get as sick, but it\u2019s still important not to be out and about, so as not to spread the disease.  A minority of patients will get worse instead of better. This usually happens after 5-7 days of illness and these patients will have more shortness of breath and worsening cough.  If this happens, it\u2019s time to contact your doctor again or even go to an emergency room. Be sure to call first so they know you are coming.  \n\n> The numbers of people who have been diagnosed and how many have died are changing daily. As of early March, there have been over 97,000 confirmed cases, with a death toll of about 3,000 (more than 2,900 in mainland China). But these numbers are just estimates; it\u2019s still unclear how many people have actually been infected worldwide. Most of the deaths have been in adults over 60 years old who had other health concerns.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Are we all at risk for catching this new coronavirus (2019-nCoV)?**\n\n> Yes. It doesn\u2019t appear anyone is naturally immune to this particular virus and there\u2019s no reason to believe anybody has antibodies that would normally protect them. \n\n> The lack of previous experience with this pathogen is part of the reason why public health officials around the globe are working so hard to contain the spread of this particular coronavirus from Wuhan. When viruses come out like this that are both new (which means the population is highly susceptible) and can easily pass from person to person (a high transmission rate), they can be really dangerous \u2014 even if here\u2019s a low percentage of people who die from them. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Why do some people with the COVID-19 get sicker than others?**\n\n> It looks like only about 20% of people who contract this novel coronavirus need to be hospitalized. The other 80% get what feels like a bad cold and recover at home. A lot of this has to do with underlying medical conditions. People who are more vulnerable to any kind of infection \u2014 because of their age or chronic health conditions \u2014 are more at risk for getting really sick from COVID-19. \n\n> That said, some otherwise healthy people do seem to be getting sicker from this infection than we would expect. We don\u2019t understand why that is or what might be different about these patients. If you have COVID-19 and you are getting sicker and sicker instead of better and better, you should contact your doctor or visit an ER. Be sure to call first so they know to expect you.  \n\n&nbsp;\n\n**What kind of medical care do patients with COVID-19 need?**\n\n> About 80% of people who contract this new coronavirus will feel sick, but ultimately be just fine. It\u2019s the 20% of COVID-19 patients who get really, really sick that worry many of us in the infectious diseases field. A lot of these critically ill patients wind up needing to be hospitalized for their pneumonia-like illnesses. They typically require critical care and ventilation \u2014 special machines that help them breathe. And some need to stay on ventilators for weeks at a time. It\u2019s this portion of patients that is most concerning. Depending on how many cases develop here in the U.S., providing that level of care for so many people over a number of weeks runs the risk of overwhelming the nation\u2019s health care system pretty quickly. We can help prevent this kind of \u201csurge\u201d in patients by practicing social distancing (see below for more explanation). \n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Should people be more concerned about the seasonal flu or COVID-19?**\n \n> There\u2019s widespread seasonal flu activity going on right now all around the U.S.  But there are steps you can take to protect yourself from influenza. You can get an annual flu shot. You can take medication like Tamiflu that protects you from getting influenza after you\u2019ve been exposed. You can cover your mouth and wash your hands to mitigate the spread. And, like clockwork, this year\u2019s influenza strain is going to die out in the spring because it will have run its course. \n\n> The challenge with COVID-19 is that we probably can\u2019t contain it and we don\u2019t know if we\u2019re really prepared as a country for a massive coronavirus epidemic.  If we are lucky, it will slow down a bit over the summer but the next few months look like they are going to be pretty tough for all of us. We need to be as ready as we can for whatever comes our way and know that we will get through it eventually. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n**How can I protect myself?  Should I wear a facemask?**\n  \n> Take the preventive actions you do for the cold and flu. This includes avoiding close contact with people who are sick; not touching your eyes, nose and mouth; washing your hands thoroughly and frequently; and cleaning and disinfecting objects and surfaces you come in contact with regularly.\n\n> The CDC does not recommend you wear a facemask to protect yourself from getting COVID-19 or other respiratory illnesses. Those who have COVID-19 and/or are showing symptoms should wear a mask to protect others from getting the virus.  Any healthcare worker taking care of someone infected with COVID-19 also should wear a mask.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Can I take an antibiotic or vaccinate against the virus?**\n \n> There is no antibiotic (they are designed for bacterial infections, not viral ones) to treat COVID-19.  Scientists are already working on a vaccine, but we don\u2019t expect to have a good vaccine until spring of 2021 at the earliest.  However, ongoing trials in China suggest that there are some existing antiviral drugs that may be helpful for the sickest patients.  In fact, the University of Chicago is part of a multi-institutional team that has mapped a protein of SARS-CoV-2 and found drugs previously in development for SARS could be effective for COVID-19.\n\n> For now, doctors can only treat the symptoms, not the virus itself."

What is a novel coronavirus?**\n\n> A coronavirus is actually the name for a set of illnesses, including the common cold and other respiratory infections. A novel coronavirus means it\u2019s a new virus that originated in animals, but has jumped to humans. This particular 2019 novel coronavirus from Wuhan is called COVID-19 or 2019-nCoV.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**How does the Wuhan coronavirus spread?**\n\n> So far, there\u2019s limited information about the Wuhan novel coronavirus, including how easy it is to spread and how dangerous it is. But we know the virus can be transmitted from person to person and it is passed by coughing and other close contact.\n\n> Close contact is a vague term that means a lot of things to different people. But in this case, it specifically means being within about six feet of someone for a prolonged period of time without wearing recommended personal protective equipment such as a disposable face mask. It could also be having direct contact with infectious secretions of someone who has a case of the virus (for example: being coughed on) while not wearing personal protective equipment.\n\n> That can sound scary, but it\u2019s important to know that influenza is also transmitted the same way.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**What are the symptoms of the virus?** \n\n> We\u2019re still learning more about Wuhan novel coronavirus, but we know it typically causes flu-like symptoms including a fever, cough and congestion. Some patients \u2014 particularly the elderly and others with other chronic health conditions \u2014 develop a severe form of pneumonia.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Are we all at risk for catching this new coronavirus (2019-nCoV)?**\n\n> Yes.

People who are more vulnerable to any kind of infection \u2014 because of their age or chronic health conditions \u2014 are more at risk for getting really sick from this novel coronavirus too. \n\n> That said, some otherwise healthy people do seem to be getting more sick from this infection than we would expect. We don\u2019t understand why that is or what might be different about those people. Thanks to the work of scientists and doctors on the ground in China, which is really nothing short of heroic, we\u2019re learning a little more every single day.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Is this coronavirus deadly?**\n\n> The numbers of how many people have been diagnosed or how many have died are changing rapidly. Without accurate numerators and denominators, the jury\u2019s still out. That said, we do know that more than 100 people in China have died from this virus. Based on the information I\u2019m seeing, it looks very similar to SARS in a number of ways \u2014 except for the fact that it\u2019s likely less deadly, but more transmittable.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**What kind of medical care do patients with the Wuhan coronavirus need?**\n\n> About 80% of people who contract this new coronavirus will feel sick, but ultimately be just fine.

There\u2019s no vaccine yet."

        "Text": "The Truth\nby Brandon J Raub on Friday, November 11, 2011 at 10:00am\n\nAmerica has lost itself.  We have lost who we truly are.  This is the land of the free and the home of the brave.  This is the land of Thomas Jefferson.  This is the land of Benjamin Franklin.  This is the land of Fredrick Douglas.  This is the land of Smedley Butler.  This is the land John F. Kennedy.  This is the land of Martin Luther King.  This is the land where the cowboy wins.  This is the land where you can start from the bottom and get to the top.  This is the land where regardless of you race and ethnicity you can suceed and build a better life for you and your family.  This is the land where every race coexists peacefully.  This is the land where justice wins.  This is the land where liberty dwells. This is the land where freedom reigns.  This is the land where we help the poor, and people help eachother.  This is land where people beat racism.\n\n \n\nThe federal reserve is wrong.  They have designed a system based off of gread and fear.  They designed a system to crush the middle class between taxes and inflation.  This is wrong, and it is unjust.  It is wrong.\n\n \n\nWe have allowed ourselves to be devieced and seduced by the powers of the printing press.  It is not a good system.  It discourages saving: the foundation for all stable economic activity.  The federal reserve is artificially manipulating interests rates and creating phony economic data.  This thing has decieved our entire nation.\n\n \n\nThey created it 1913.  They also created the income tax in 1913.  They encouraged the growth of debt so they can tax you on it.  There is interest on the debt.  Your government is in bed with these people.  They want to enslave you to the government so that they can control every aspect of your lives.  It is an empire based on lies.  They operate of greed and fear.\n\n \n\nThere is a better way.  It's called freedom.  Freedom is called a lot of things.  But there is a true meaning.  It means very simply that you have the right to do whatever you want as long as you are not infringing on the feedoms of other people.\n\n \n\nI firmly believe that God set America apart from the other nations of the world.  He saved a place where people could come to to escape bad systems of goverment.  This system we have created works.  It really works.\n\n \n\nThere is evil going on all around the world.  The United States was meant to lead the charge against injustice, but through our example not our force.  People do not respond to having liberty and freedom forced on them.\n\n \n\nMen and Women follow courage.  They follow leadership, and courage.  Our example has paved the way for people all around the world to change their forms of goverment.\n\n \n\nForce is not the way because liberty is a powerful concept.  The idea that men can govern themselves is the basis for every just form of government. \n\n \n\nWe can govern ourselves.  We do not need to be governed by men who want to install a one world banking system.  These men have machine hearts.  Machine and unnatural hearts.  They have blocked out the possibility of a better world.  They fear human progress.  They have monopolies on everything.\n\n \n\nThis life can be free and beautiful.  There are enough resources on this earth to support the world's population.  There are enough resources on this earth to feed everyone.  There is enough land for everyone to own their own land and farm, and produce their own energy.\n\n \n\nThese people have been hiding technology.  There are ways to create power easily.  There is technology that can provide free cheap power for everyone.  There are farming techniques that can feed the entire world.\n\n \n\nThey are controlling your media.  They have dumbed you down through your school systems.  They have systematically dismantled the constitution.  It is in rags.\n\n \n\nThe bill of rights is being systematically dismantled.  Men have spilled their blood for those rights.\n\n \n\nYour sons and daughters, your brothers and sisters, and Americas best young men and women are loosing their limbs.  They are loosing their lives.  They are loosing the hearts.  They do not know why they are fighting.  They are killing.  And they do not know why.\n\n \n\nThey have done some extroadinary acts.  Their deeds go before them.  But these wars are lies.  They are lies.  They decieved our entire nation with terrorism.  They have gotten us to hand them our rights.  Our Rights!  Men died for those rights!\n\n \n\nSeptember Eleventh was an inside job.  They blew up a third building in broad daylight.  Building 7.\n\n \n\nYour leaders betrayed you.\n\n \n\nYou elected an aristocracy.  They are beholden to special interests.  They were brainwashed through the Council on Foreign Relations.  Your leaders are planning to merge the United States into a one world banking system.  They want to put computer chips in you.\n\n \n\nThese men have evil hearts.  They have tricked you into supporting corporate facism.  We gave them the keys to our country.  We were not vigilant with our republic.\n\n \n\nThere is hope.  BUT WE MUST TAKE OUR REPUBLIC BACK."

Andrew Cuomo said Tuesday.\n\nThe Cuomo administration said it has delivered letters to various banks and mortgage service providers asking they \"use maximum discretion and effort to speed the release of funds.\"\n\n\"Families need to be able to return to their homes and the state economy, which took a hit from Superstorm Sandy, needs the boost from spending on repairs,\" Cuomo said in a written statement. \"After insurance companies have sent homeowners checks to pay for repairs, the money should not be sitting with the bank because of red tape.\"\n\nA month of outrage later, Senate passes Sandy relief \n\nThe state's Department of Financial Services found that four of the biggest U.S. banks -- Wells Fargo, Bank of America, Citibank and JP Morgan Chase -- are holding more than 4,100 checks worth more $130 million. The banks were not immediately available for comment, though have maintained that they were socked with a massive amount in payouts that require processing in the wake of the storm.\n\nThousands of storm-battered residents are still awaiting a total of $208 million in insurance checks.\nCuomo said the payouts are often issued jointly to the homeowner and their bank or mortgage servicer, which then requires the \"bank's endorsement of the check before the homeowner may access the funds.\"\n\nDelays can follow when banks request proof of repairs or servicing required by federal mortgage agencies. But many residents have complained that they haven't received the funds they need to start the repairs.\n\nSuperstorm Sandy left 132 people dead in the United States and contributed to tens of billions of dollars worth of damages, especially along shoreline communities in New York, New Jersey and parts of Connecticut.\n---------\n*\u00a9 2013 Cable News Network.
