Sure he became more of a mascot to sell toys, but the movie does a great job showcasing his change from a being solely bent on destruction to am essential part of Lilo and Nani's family.\n\nEdit: God dammit just got to the part where he realizes that he is the cause of the destruction of Lilo and Nani's family and he leaves. Sunuvabitch why am I more sentimental now than when I was a child?!?!?!",

That opening song (\u201cHe Mele No Lilo\u201d) gets me going every time I hear it. \n\nThere\u2019s something about sibling love and rivalry throughout this entire film that seemed to bond us. Growing up we were very different kids and a nasty divorce made it even more difficult for us to be kids together. \n\nBut watching that destructive blue menace be embraced by love despite his many issues was so heartwarming. Love brought out the love from within him. I sometimes feel like that movie was one of those warm love moments that kept my sister and I together. It gave us a common ground and a place to sit next to each other and be lost in a cartoon world for a few hours.",

I hate when tv shows paint the pretty, and popular characters as vapid. Courtney showed that she was charismatic, curious, funny, and fabulous. On the other hand Doddie who was presented as the sidekick and the supportive best friend ended up being opportunistic, a social climber and desperate. I also love how raw Gingers relationship is with her father, it was quite heartbreaking. I will also defend the art style, I love it! I find this show extremely cozy.

Every time I show someone new, it usually follows the same format - I'll usually bring it up fairly organically, mention that it's only like 2 hours long, I already own it, and we don't even have to watch the whole thing, and then after the first episode everyone's like \"Yup, play the next one, now we have to finish it.\"\n\nIt's usually Greg that gets them to stick around...that and the general atmosphere of the show, especially since I almost always bring it up on the same sort of fall day where I'm with a few people and we're just lazing around having a few drinks and not really wanting to go outside and do anything. I know it's a Halloween show, but it's usually still pretty warm on Halloween where I live, so mid-late November ends up feeling the most appropriate, and I've definitely trapped people into it post-Thanksgiving dinner.",

Before dying, she had the hope that she was wrong about everything and gave each of her friends a portion of her soul to survive the brought-forth apocalypse, granting them the chance they needed to survive and fight a bit longer. \n\nAfter all was said and done, and after it had cost her her very own life, she finally understood that her destiny was what she chose for it to be and not what others told her it was. Though she failed the first time, she was given a second chance to change it all and took it. Having grown from that experience, she came back stronger, more balanced, and more trusting in those who loved her, chose who truly was her family and ended up saving her world from her father.\n\nTruly a great metaphor for life's choices, free will, and the dooming feeling of a predestined life. A great arc for a great character.\n\nEDIT: For those asking, Raven sacrifices herself in the 1st episode of the 3 part finale to Season 4 called \"The End\".",

On my bad days, it feels like I\u2019m constantly holding my mind back and struggling against something that is not me constantly putting me down. Raven has to maintain emotional balance in order to keep her powers in check, which I resonate with.\n\nThat\u2019s actually another part of Raven\u2019s growth. She was taught emotional balance by the monks. What she learned instead was emotional numbness. She led herself to believe she could never feel anything at all when really it was she couldn\u2019t be chaotic with her emotions. She had to learn self regulation, like all mentally ill people do.",

I'm not going to lie, there were moments when I though to myself *what the hell am I watching* (I usually watched it during a 2 hour break in between classes while in college). Nevertheless, it really grew on me and I came to relate a lot to the character of Raven (main reason why I kept watching). It's a dumb, silly show; but it has a special charm to it that I haven't really seen in other shows. In the end, it became one of my favorite animated shows ever.",

Such expertly done theming around her character and the way they slowly construct her as a pure foil to Rapunzel. She adds so much to the story that the movie feels empty without her. Her arc is basically what Elsa should have been in Frozen, it\u2019s so much better fleshed out and developed. Not to mention that every song she sings is an absolute banger, and super relatable. I\u2019m pretty new to the show so idk if many others feel the same but damn, Cass is one of the best recent Disney characters, if not the best, and she\u2019s so underrated.",

I spent years feeling partially responsible for my dads death. I won\u2019t go into detail but I always felt like I understood how Simba felt. I definitely went through a \u201dHakuna Matata phase\u201d, repressed everything and distracted myself with partying. Seeing Simba rise above the sadness and anger to restore his home and family is always therapeutic for me. I\u2019m in a much better place now, but The Lion King is still really important to me.",

I liked seeing Rigby going from disliking Eileen to becoming friends to dating, wanting to finish high school so he feels good enough for her, and eventually getting married and having kids.\n\nAlso as much of a SIMP Mordecai was, I liked the episode where both him and Margaret sit down st a restaurant and see their potential future yet they decide to go against it. I always liked CJ, but I agreed with the shows writers to have him marry someone after his life at the park since that's a new chapter for him.\n\nI wish Hi Five Ghost had more focus, he always felt like a side character instead of one of the main 7.",
