            "Body": "**TL;DR: We\u2019re working with mods to change our content policy to explicitly address hate.** u/kn0thing **has resigned from our board to fill his seat with a Black candidate, a request we will honor. I want to take responsibility for the history of our policies over the years that got us here, and we still have work to do.**\n\nAfter watching people across the country mourn and demand an end to centuries of murder and violent discrimination against Black people, I wanted to speak out. I wanted to do this both as a human being, who sees this grief and pain and knows I have been spared from it myself because of the color of my skin, and as someone who literally has a platform and, with it, a duty to speak out.\n\nEarlier this week, I wrote an email to our company addressing this crisis and a few ways Reddit will respond. When we shared it, many of the responses said something like, \u201cHow can a company that has faced racism from users on its own platform over the years credibly take such a position?\u201d\n\nThese questions, which I know are coming from a place of real pain and which I take to heart, are really a statement: There is an unacceptable gap between our beliefs as people and a company, and what you see in our content policy. \n\nOver the last fifteen years, hundreds of millions of people have come to Reddit for things that I believe are fundamentally good: user-driven communities\u2014across a wider spectrum of interests and passions than I could\u2019ve imagined when we first created subreddits\u2014and the kinds of content and conversations that keep people coming back day after day. It's why we come to Reddit as users, as mods, and as employees who want to bring this sort of community and belonging to the world and make it better daily.\n\nHowever, as Reddit has grown, alongside much good, it is facing its own challenges around hate and racism. We have to acknowledge and accept responsibility for the role we have played. Here are three problems we are most focused on:\n\n* Parts of Reddit reflect an unflattering but real resemblance to the world in the hate that Black users and communities see daily, despite the progress we have made in improving our tooling and enforcement. \n* Users and moderators genuinely do not have enough clarity as to where we as administrators stand on racism. \n* Our moderators are frustrated and need a real seat at the table to help shape the policies that they help us enforce.\n\nWe are already working to fix these problems, and this is a promise for more urgency. Our current [content policy](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy) is effectively nine rules for what you cannot do on Reddit. In many respects, it\u2019s served us well. Under it, we have made meaningful progress cleaning up the platform (and done so without undermining the free expression and authenticity that fuels Reddit). That said, we still have work to do. This current policy lists only what you cannot do, articulates none of the values behind the rules, and does not explicitly take a stance on hate or racism.\n\nWe will update our content policy to include a vision for Reddit and its communities to aspire to, a statement on hate, the context for the rules, and a principle that Reddit isn\u2019t to be used as a weapon. We have details to work through, and while we will move quickly, I do want to be thoughtful and also gather feedback from our moderators (through our Mod Councils). With more moderator engagement, the timeline is weeks, not months.\n\nAnd just this morning, Alexis Ohanian (u/kn0thing), my Reddit cofounder, announced that he is resigning from our board and that he wishes for his seat to be filled with a Black candidate, a request that the board and I will honor. We thank Alexis for this meaningful gesture and all that he\u2019s done for us over the years.\n\nAt the risk of making this unreadably long, I'd like to take this moment to share how we got here in the first place, where we have made progress, and where, despite our best intentions, we have fallen short.\n\nIn the early days of Reddit, 2005\u20132006, our idealistic \u201cpolicy\u201d was that, excluding spam, we would not remove content. We were small and did not face many hard decisions. When this ideal was tested, we [banned racist users](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/6m87a/can_we_ban_this_extremely_racist_asshole/c0497kd/?context=3) anyway. In the end, we acted based on our beliefs, despite our \u201cpolicy.\u201d \n\nI left Reddit from 2010\u20132015. During this time, in addition to rapid user growth, Reddit\u2019s no-removal policy [ossified](https://redditblog.com/2014/09/06/every-man-is-responsible-for-his-own-soul/) and its content policy took [no position on hate](https://web.archive.org/web/20150710230652/https://www.reddit.com/rules/). \n\nWhen I returned in 2015, my top priority was creating a content policy to do two things: deal with hateful communities I had been immediately confronted with (like r/CoonTown, which was explicitly designed to spread racist hate) and provide a clear policy of what\u2019s acceptable on Reddit and what\u2019s not. [We banned that community and others](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/3fx2au/content_policy_update/ctsqobs/) because they were \u201cmaking Reddit worse\u201d but were not clear and direct about their role in sowing hate. We crafted our [2015 policy](https://web.archive.org/web/20150806171017/https://www.reddit.com/help/contentpolicy) around behaviors adjacent to hate that were actionable and objective: violence and harassment, because we struggled to create a definition of hate and racism that we could defend and enforce at our scale. Through continual updates to these policies [2017](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/78p7bz/update_on_sitewide_rules_regarding_violent_content/), [2018](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/863xcj/new_addition_to_sitewide_rules_regarding_the_use/), [2019](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/dbf9nj/changes_to_our_policy_against_bullying_and/), [2020](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditsecurity/comments/emd7yx/updates_to_our_policy_around_impersonation/) (and a broader definition of violence), we have removed thousands of hateful communities. \n\nWhile we dealt with many communities themselves, we still did not provide the clarity\u2014and it showed, both in our enforcement and in confusion about where we stand. In 2018, I confusingly said [racism is not against the rules, but also isn\u2019t welcome on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/3fx2au/content_policy_update/ctsqobs/). This gap between our content policy and our values has eroded our effectiveness in combating hate and racism on Reddit; I accept full responsibility for this.\n\nThis inconsistency has hurt our trust with our users and moderators and has made us slow to respond to problems. This was also true with r/the_donald, a community that relished in exploiting and detracting from the best of Reddit and that is now nearly disintegrated on their own accord. As we looked to our policies, \u201cBreaking Reddit\u201d was not a sufficient explanation for actioning a political subreddit, and I fear we let being technically correct get in the way of doing the right thing. Clearly, we should have quarantined it sooner.\n\nThe majority of our top communities have a rule banning hate and racism, which makes us proud, and is evidence why a [community-led approach is the only way to scale moderation online](https://docs.house.gov/meetings/IF/IF16/20191016/110075/HHRG-116-IF16-Wstate-HuffmanS-20191016.pdf). That said, this is not a rule communities should have to write for themselves and we need to rebalance the burden of enforcement. I also accept responsibility for this. \n\nDespite making significant progress over the years, we have to turn a mirror on ourselves and be willing to do the hard work of making sure we are living up to our values in our product and policies. This is a significant moment. We have a choice: return to the status quo or use this opportunity for change. We at Reddit are opting for the latter, and we will do our very best to be a part of the progress.\n\nI will be sticking around for a while to answer questions as usual, but I also know that our policies and actions will speak louder than our comments.\n\nThanks,\n\nSteve"

I\u2019ll stick around to answer your questions about the report (and other topics) in the comments.**\n\nHi all,\n\nIt\u2019s that time of year again when we share Reddit\u2019s annual transparency report.\n\nWe share this report each year because you have a right to know how user data is being managed by Reddit, and how it\u2019s both shared and not shared with government and non-government parties.\n\nYou\u2019ll find information on content removed from Reddit and requests for user information. This year, we\u2019ve expanded the report to include new data\u2014specifically, a breakdown of content policy removals, content manipulation removals, subreddit removals, and subreddit quarantines.\n\n## By the numbers\n\nSince the [full report](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/transparency-report-2019) is rather long, I\u2019ll call out a few stats below:\n\n**ADMIN REMOVALS**\n\n* In 2019, we removed **\\~53M** pieces of content in total, mostly for spam and content manipulation (e.g. brigading and vote cheating), exclusive of legal/copyright removals, which we track separately.\n* For [Content Policy](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy) violations, we removed\n   * **222k** **pieces of content**,\n   * **55.9k accounts**, and\n   * **21.9k** **subreddits** (**87%** of which were removed for being unmoderated).\n* Additionally, we quarantined **256 subreddits**.\n\n**LEGAL REMOVALS**\n\n* Reddit received **110 requests** from government entities to remove content, of which we complied with **37.3%**.\n* In 2019 we removed about **5x more** content for copyright infringement than in 2018, largely due to copyright notices for adult-entertainment and notices targeting pieces of content that had already been removed.\n\n**REQUESTS FOR USER INFORMATION**\n\n* We received a total of **772 requests** for user account information from law enforcement and government entities.\n   * **366** of these were emergency disclosure requests, mostly from US law enforcement (**68%** of which we complied with).\n   * **406** were non-emergency requests (**73%** of which we complied with); most were US subpoenas.\n   * Reddit received an additional **224 requests** to temporarily preserve certain user account information (**86%** of which we complied with).\n* Note: We carefully review each request for compliance with applicable laws and regulations. If we determine that a request is not legally valid, Reddit will challenge or reject it. (You can read more in our [Privacy Policy](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/privacy-policy) and [Guidelines for Law Enforcement](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/guidelines-for-law-enforcement).)\n\n## While I have your attention...\n\nI\u2019d like to share an update about our thinking around quarantined communities.\n\nWhen we [expanded our quarantine policy](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/9jf8nh/revamping_the_quarantine_function/), we created an appeals process for sanctioned communities. One of the goals was to \u201cforce subscribers to reconsider their behavior and incentivize moderators to make changes.\u201d While the policy attempted to hold moderators more accountable for enforcing healthier rules and norms, it didn\u2019t address the role that each member plays in the health of their community.\n\nToday, we\u2019re making an update to address this gap: Users who consistently upvote policy-breaking content within quarantined communities will receive automated warnings, followed by further consequences like a temporary or permanent suspension. We hope this will encourage healthier behavior across these communities.\n\n## If you\u2019ve read this far\n\nIn addition to this report, we share news throughout the year from teams across Reddit, and if you like posts about what we\u2019re doing, you can stay up to date and talk to our teams in r/RedditSecurity, r/ModNews, r/redditmobile, and r/changelog.\n\n**As usual, I\u2019ll be sticking around to answer your questions in the comments. AMA.**\n\nUpdate: I'm off for now. Thanks for questions, everyone."

We value your privacy and believe you have a right to know how data is being managed by Reddit and how it is shared (and not shared) with governmental and non-governmental parties.\n\nWe\u2019ve included a breakdown of requests from governmental entities worldwide and from private parties from within the United States. The most common types of requests are subpoenas, court orders, search warrants, and emergency requests. In 2018, Reddit received a total of 581 requests to produce user account information from both United States and foreign governmental entities, which represents a 151% increase from the year before. We scrutinize all requests and object when appropriate, and we didn\u2019t disclose any information for 23% of the requests. We received 28 requests from foreign government authorities for the production of user account information and did not comply with any of those requests.\n\nThis year, we expanded the report to included details on two additional types of content removals: those taken by us at Reddit, Inc., and those taken by subreddit moderators (including Automod actions). We remove content that is in violation of our site-wide policies, but subreddits often have additional rules specific to the [purpose, tone, and norms of their community](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~sjhaver3/The-internets-hidden-rules-cscw2018.pdf). You can now see the breakdown of these two types of takedowns for a more holistic view of company and community actions.\n\nIn other news, you may have heard that we closed an additional round of funding this week, which gives us more runway and will help us continue to improve our platform. What else does this mean for you? Not much. Our strategy and governance model remain the same. And\u2014of course\u2014we do not share specific user data with any investor, new or old.\n\nI\u2019ll hang around for a while to answer your questions.\n\n\u2013Steve\n\n&#x200B;\n\nedit: Thanks for the silver you cheap bastards.\n\nupdate: I'm out for now.

Nevertheless, we will continue to fight for the open internet (and occasionally pester you with posts encouraging you to fight for it, too).\n\nWe also had a lot of fun fighting for the *not-so-free* but perfectly balanced world of r/thanosdidnothingwrong. I\u2019m always amazed to see redditors so engaged with their communities that they get [Snoo tattoos](https://www.reddit.com/r/thanosdidnothingwrong/comments/8zcga8/perfectly_balanced_as_all_things_should_be/). \n\nSpeaking of bans, you\u2019ve probably noticed that over the past few months we\u2019ve banned a few subreddits and [quarantined](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/9jf8nh/revamping_the_quarantine_function/) several more. We don't take the banning of subreddits lightly, but we will continue to enforce our policies (and be transparent with all of you when we make changes to them) and use other tools to encourage a healthy ecosystem for communities. We\u2019ve been investing heavily in our Anti-Evil and Trust & Safety teams, as well as a new team devoted solely to investigating and preventing efforts to interfere with our site, state-sponsored and otherwise. We also recognize the ways that redditors themselves actively help flag potential suspicious actors, and we\u2019re working on a system to allow you all to [report directly to this team](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModSupport/comments/9hjkv5/so_about_those_suspicious_activity_reports/).\n\nOn the product side, our teams have been hard at work shipping countless updates to our [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/reddit-the-official-app/id1064216828?mt=8) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=reddit+Inc.&hl=en) apps, like universal search and News. We\u2019ve also expanded Chat on mobile and desktop and launched an opt-in subreddit chat, which we\u2019ve already seen communities using for game-day discussions and chats about TV shows. We started testing out a new hub for [OC (Original Content)](https://www.reddit.com/original) and a [Save Drafts feature](https://www.reddit.com/r/redesign/comments/8k8d1x/beta_new_save_draft_feature_for_text_and_link/) (with shared drafts as well) for text and link posts in the redesign. \n\nSpeaking of which, we\u2019ve made a ton of improvements to the redesign since we last talked about it in April. \n\nIncluding but not limited to\u2026 night mode, user & post flair improvements, [better traffic pages for ](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/954a8p/traffic_page_update_see_your_subreddits_traffic/)\n\n[mods](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/954a8p/traffic_page_update_see_your_subreddits_traffic/), accessibility improvements, keyboard shortcuts, a bunch of new community widgets, fixing key AutoMod integrations, and the ability to [have community styling show up on mobile as well](https://i.redd.it/l12cv7lqmwf11.png), which was one of the main reasons why we took on the redesign in the first place. I know you all have had a lot of feedback since we first launched it ([I have too](https://www.reddit.com/r/redesign/comments/8d8qws/despite_everyone_saying_the_redesign_is_perfect/)). Our teams have poured a tremendous amount of work into shipping improvements, and their #1 focus now is on improving performance. If you haven\u2019t checked it out in a while, I encourage you to [give it a spin](http://new.reddit.com/).\n\nLast but not least, on the community front, we just wrapped our second annual Moderator Thank You Roadshow, where the rest of the admins and I got the chance to meet mods in different cities, have [a bit of fun](https://www.reddit.com/r/boston/comments/8u5cca/quick_while_we_are_all_at_the_game/), and chat about Reddit. We also launched a new [Mod Help Center](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/9bnj3a/we_launched_a_new_knowledge_base_for_mods_and_we/) and new mod tools for Chat and the redesign, with more fun stuff (like Modmail Search) on the way.\n\nOther than that, I can\u2019t imagine we have much to talk about, but I\u2019ll hang to around some questions anyway.\n\n\u2014spez"

In this letter, you claim \u201cas Snoos, we do not tolerate hate, racism, and violence, and while we have work to do to fight these on our platform, our values are clear.\u201d\n\nAs of today, neither you nor any other Reddit admins have shared this letter anywhere on reddit.com. However, [the response to this message was swift on Twitter](https://twitter.com/reddit/status/1267643352851247106), where you were rightfully labeled as hypocritical based on your long and well-recorded history of defending racism and white supremacy on this site. \n\nAmong the many responses was this message from former CEO of Reddit, Ellen Pao. \n\n>[I am obligated to call you out: You should have shut down the_donald instead of amplifying it and its hate, racism, and violence. So much of what is happening now lies at your feet. You don't get to say BLM when reddit nurtures and monetizes white supremacy and hate all day long](https://twitter.com/ekp/status/1267689503797342208)\n\nMany others shared links and screenshots of your past statements saying [\u201cOpen racism and slurs are fine to post on Reddit\u201d](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/apr/12/racism-slurs-reddit-post-ceo-steve-huffman).\n\nThe problem of Reddit\u2019s leadership supporting and providing a platform for racist users and hateful communities has long been an issue.  Nearly six years ago, [dozens of subreddits signed the original open letter to the Reddit admins](https://www.reddit.com/r/blackladies/comments/2ejg1b/we_have_a_racist_user_problem_and_reddit_wont/) calling for action.  While [the Reddit admins acknowledged the letter](https://www.reddit.com/r/blackladies/comments/2m9k6p/maybe_its_time_to_repost_the_open_letter_reddit/cm27j8j/) and said it was a high priority to address this issue, extremely little has been done in the intervening years.\n\nOn June 5, you shared this update on /r/Announcements, [Upcoming changes to our content policy, our board, and where we\u2019re going from here](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/gxas21/upcoming_changes_to_our_content_policy_our_board/).  In the post, you stated that there is a need for continued adjustments of Reddit\u2019s content policy to address racism and that this remains a priority.  These continued statements that you hear us, that this is a priority, or that you are working on it are not enough.  It has been five years since your return as CEO and this still remains Reddit\u2019s most glaring problem.\n\nSteve, if you and Reddit genuinely care about the values of standing up to racism and hate, then you need to back it up with real action.  As moderators on this website who have dedicated countless hours to keeping this site running, we call on Reddit to take the following steps:\n\n* **Enact a sitewide policy against racism, slurs, and hatespeech targeted at protected groups.** For too many years, Steve Huffman and the other Admins have stood by and allowed this site to fester with hate in the name of \u201cfree speech.\u201d  It is time to enact a specific and detailed policy that protects the disadvantaged members of our communities from hate based on their sexuality, gender identity, ethnicity, country of origin, religion, or disability.\n\n* **Be proactive in banning hate-based communities**  In the past Reddit has only taken action on hate subreddits when they were featured in the news and risked Reddit\u2019s reputation or when they were documented and featured on /r/AgainstHateSubreddits and other forums.  AHS should not have to be responsible for raising awareness of hate subreddits and reporting them to the admins.  This site should take responsibility for keeping its users safe by banning any remaining subreddits devoted to hate and racism and preventing the creation of hateful subreddits in the future. \n\n* **Be proactive in banning hate users** Reddit needs to not only ban hate subreddits, but must be proactive in banning the moderators of these subreddits and their most active users.  Too often these users have been allowed to stay on this website after numerous sitewide violations, letting them move on to participate in new hate communities and spread their vitriol further across this site.\n\n* **Reddit needs to hire more minorities / women, especially in leadership roles** Reddit needs to hire more women and people of color \u2014 particularly in leadership roles in the company \u2014 to help shift the corporate culture and policies to be more equitable for all.  In addition, Reddit needs to take adequate steps to protect these employees from harassment. \n\n* **Reddit needs to hire more community managers** According to Reddit's [job listings](https://www.redditinc.com/careers) there are dozens of open positions that the company is hiring for, and yet not a single one for Community.  Reddit has enacted numerous policies over the years that have been detrimental to the ability of Reddit\u2019s moderators or the broader Reddit community.  Reddit needs more community managers to build positive relations and engagement with the site\u2019s volunteer moderators.\n\n* **Honor Alexis Ohanian's wishes to have his Reddit Board seat filled with a black candidate** - On June 5, Reddit Co-Founder and Executive Chairman [announced that he would be stepping down](https://twitter.com/alexisohanian/status/1268943036228292608) from his role on Reddit's Board of Directors.  Alexis requested that his position be filled with a black candidate and we ask Reddit to honor that request.  While you have stated your intent to honor that request, we are asking for an announcement to be made on this decision in the next 3 months.  We believe this is not an issue that should be put off for action years down the road.\n\nAt /r/AgainstHateSubreddits, we have laid out the many failures of Steve time and again to stand up to white supremacy on this site [time]( https://www.reddit.com/r/AgainstHateSubreddits/comments/gv7mtn/steve_spez_huffman_is_finally_claiming_that_black/) and [time]( https://www.reddit.com/r/AgainstHateSubreddits/comments/a3q6ck/2018_reddit_review_a_year_of_hate_propaganda_and/) and [time]( https://www.reddit.com/r/AgainstHateSubreddits/comments/84q74p/bbc_calls_out_rthe_donald_for_being_a_thriving/) again.\n\nWith a website with the impact of Reddit on the broader conversations being held in communities around the world, this website needs real leadership and real action.\n\nWe hope that Reddit will not just share empty platitudes \u2014 but will take a meaningful stand against hate, and take these recommendations to heart.\n\nThis letter is co-signed by more than ~~200~~ ~~**300**~~ ~~**350**~~ ~~**430**~~ ~~**550**~~ ~~**650**~~ **800** communities representing ~~well over

I wanted to do this both as a human being, who sees this grief and pain and knows I have been spared from it myself because of the color of my skin, and as someone who literally has a platform and, with it, a duty to speak out.\n\nEarlier this week, I wrote an email to our company addressing this crisis and a few ways Reddit will respond. When we shared it, many of the responses said something like, \u201cHow can a company that has faced racism from users on its own platform over the years credibly take such a position?\u201d\n\nThese questions, which I know are coming from a place of real pain and which I take to heart, are really a statement: There is an unacceptable gap between our beliefs as people and a company, and what you see in our content policy. \n\nOver the last fifteen years, hundreds of millions of people have come to Reddit for things that I believe are fundamentally good: user-driven communities\u2014across a wider spectrum of interests and passions than I could\u2019ve imagined when we first created subreddits\u2014and the kinds of content and conversations that keep people coming back day after day. It's why we come to Reddit as users, as mods, and as employees who want to bring this sort of community and belonging to the world and make it better daily.\n\nHowever, as Reddit has grown, alongside much good, it is facing its own challenges around hate and racism. We have to acknowledge and accept responsibility for the role we have played. Here are three problems we are most focused on:\n\n* Parts of Reddit reflect an unflattering but real resemblance to the world in the hate that Black users and communities see daily, despite the progress we have made in improving our tooling and enforcement. \n* Users and moderators genuinely do not have enough clarity as to where we as administrators stand on racism. \n* Our moderators are frustrated and need a real seat at the table to help shape the policies that they help us enforce.\n\nWe are already working to fix these problems, and this is a promise for more urgency. Our current [content policy](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy) is effectively nine rules for what you cannot do on Reddit. In many respects, it\u2019s served us well. Under it, we have made meaningful progress cleaning up the platform (and done so without undermining the free expression and authenticity that fuels Reddit). That said, we still have work to do. This current policy lists only what you cannot do, articulates none of the values behind the rules, and does not explicitly take a stance on hate or racism.\n\nWe will update our content policy to include a vision for Reddit and its communities to aspire to, a statement on hate, the context for the rules, and a principle that Reddit isn\u2019t to be used as a weapon. We have details to work through, and while we will move quickly, I do want to be thoughtful and also gather feedback from our moderators (through our Mod Councils). With more moderator engagement, the timeline is weeks, not months.\n\nAnd just this morning, Alexis Ohanian (u/kn0thing), my Reddit cofounder, announced that he is resigning from our board and that he wishes for his seat to be filled with a Black candidate, a request that the board and I will honor. We thank Alexis for this meaningful gesture and all that he\u2019s done for us over the years.\n\nAt the risk of making this unreadably long, I'd like to take this moment to share how we got here in the first place, where we have made progress, and where, despite our best intentions, we have fallen short.\n\nIn the early days of Reddit, 2005\u20132006, our idealistic \u201cpolicy\u201d was that, excluding spam, we would not remove content. We were small and did not face many hard decisions. When this ideal was tested, we [banned racist users](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/6m87a/can_we_ban_this_extremely_racist_asshole/c0497kd/?context=3) anyway. In the end, we acted based on our beliefs, despite our \u201cpolicy.\u201d \n\nI left Reddit from 2010\u20132015. During this time, in addition to rapid user growth, Reddit\u2019s no-removal policy [ossified](https://redditblog.com/2014/09/06/every-man-is-responsible-for-his-own-soul/) and its content policy took [no position on hate](https://web.archive.org/web/20150710230652/https://www.reddit.com/rules/). \n\nWhen I returned in 2015, my top priority was creating a content policy to do two things: deal with hateful communities I had been immediately confronted with (like r/CoonTown, which was explicitly designed to spread racist hate) and provide a clear policy of what\u2019s acceptable on Reddit and what\u2019s not. [We banned that community and others](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/3fx2au/content_policy_update/ctsqobs/) because they were \u201cmaking Reddit worse\u201d but were not clear and direct about their role in sowing hate. We crafted our [2015 policy](https://web.archive.org/web/20150806171017/https://www.reddit.com/help/contentpolicy) around behaviors adjacent to hate that were actionable and objective: violence and harassment, because we struggled to create a definition of hate and racism that we could defend and enforce at our scale. Through continual updates to these policies [2017](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/78p7bz/update_on_sitewide_rules_regarding_violent_content/), [2018](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/863xcj/new_addition_to_sitewide_rules_regarding_the_use/), [2019](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/dbf9nj/changes_to_our_policy_against_bullying_and/), [2020](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditsecurity/comments/emd7yx/updates_to_our_policy_around_impersonation/) (and a broader definition of violence), we have removed thousands of hateful communities. \n\nWhile we dealt with many communities themselves, we still did not provide the clarity\u2014and it showed, both in our enforcement and in confusion about where we stand. In 2018, I confusingly said [racism is not against the rules, but also isn\u2019t welcome on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/3fx2au/content_policy_update/ctsqobs/). This gap between our content policy and our values has eroded our effectiveness in combating hate and racism on Reddit; I accept full responsibility for this.\n\nThis inconsistency has hurt our trust with our users and moderators and has made us slow to respond to problems. This was also true with r/the_donald, a community that relished in exploiting and detracting from the best of Reddit and that is now nearly disintegrated on their own accord. As we looked to our policies, \u201cBreaking Reddit\u201d was not a sufficient explanation for actioning a political subreddit, and I fear we let being technically correct get in the way of doing the right thing. Clearly, we should have quarantined it sooner.\n\nThe majority of our top communities have a rule banning hate and racism, which makes us proud, and is evidence why a [community-led approach is the only way to scale moderation online](https://docs.house.gov/meetings/IF/IF16/20191016/110075/HHRG-116-IF16-Wstate-HuffmanS-20191016.pdf). That said, this is not a rule communities should have to write for themselves and we need to rebalance the burden of enforcement. I also accept responsibility for this. \n\nDespite making significant progress over the years, we have to turn a mirror on ourselves and be willing to do the hard work of making sure we are living up to our values in our product and policies. This is a significant moment. We have a choice: return to the status quo or use this opportunity for change. We at Reddit are opting for the latter, and we will do our very best to be a part of the progress.\n\nI will be sticking around for a while to answer questions as usual, but I also know that our policies and actions will speak louder than our comments.\n\nThanks,\n\nSteve",

Our current [content policy](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy) is effectively nine rules for what you cannot do on Reddit. In many respects, it\u2019s served us well. Under it, we have made meaningful progress cleaning up the platform (and done so without undermining the free expression and authenticity that fuels Reddit). That said, we still have work to do. This current policy lists only what you cannot do, articulates none of the values behind the rules, and does not explicitly take a stance on hate or racism.\n\nWe will update our content policy to include a vision for Reddit and its communities to aspire to, a statement on hate, the context for the rules, and a principle that Reddit isn\u2019t to be used as a weapon. We have details to work through, and while we will move quickly, I do want to be thoughtful and also gather feedback from our moderators (through our Mod Councils). With more moderator engagement, the timeline is weeks, not months.\n\nAnd just this morning, Alexis Ohanian (u/kn0thing), my Reddit cofounder, announced that he is resigning from our board and that he wishes for his seat to be filled with a Black candidate, a request that the board and I will honor. We thank Alexis for this meaningful gesture and all that he\u2019s done for us over the years.\n\nAt the risk of making this unreadably long, I'd like to take this moment to share how we got here in the first place, where we have made progress, and where, despite our best intentions, we have fallen short.\n\nIn the early days of Reddit, 2005\u20132006, our idealistic \u201cpolicy\u201d was that, excluding spam, we would not remove content. We were small and did not face many hard decisions. When this ideal was tested, we [banned racist users](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/6m87a/can_we_ban_this_extremely_racist_asshole/c0497kd/?context=3) anyway. In the end, we acted based on our beliefs, despite our \u201cpolicy.\u201d \n\nI left Reddit from 2010\u20132015. During this time, in addition to rapid user growth, Reddit\u2019s no-removal policy [ossified](https://redditblog.com/2014/09/06/every-man-is-responsible-for-his-own-soul/) and its content policy took [no position on hate](https://web.archive.org/web/20150710230652/https://www.reddit.com/rules/). \n\nWhen I returned in 2015, my top priority was creating a content policy to do two things: deal with hateful communities I had been immediately confronted with (like r/CoonTown, which was explicitly designed to spread racist hate) and provide a clear policy of what\u2019s acceptable on Reddit and what\u2019s not. [We banned that community and others](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/3fx2au/content_policy_update/ctsqobs/) because they were \u201cmaking Reddit worse\u201d but were not clear and direct about their role in sowing hate. We crafted our [2015 policy](https://web.archive.org/web/20150806171017/https://www.reddit.com/help/contentpolicy) around behaviors adjacent to hate that were actionable and objective: violence and harassment, because we struggled to create a definition of hate and racism that we could defend and enforce at our scale. Through continual updates to these policies [2017](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/78p7bz/update_on_sitewide_rules_regarding_violent_content/), [2018](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/863xcj/new_addition_to_sitewide_rules_regarding_the_use/), [2019](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/dbf9nj/changes_to_our_policy_against_bullying_and/), [2020](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditsecurity/comments/emd7yx/updates_to_our_policy_around_impersonation/) (and a broader definition of violence), we have removed thousands of hateful communities. \n\nWhile we dealt with many communities themselves, we still did not provide the clarity\u2014and it showed, both in our enforcement and in confusion about where we stand. In 2018, I confusingly said [racism is not against the rules, but also isn\u2019t welcome on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/3fx2au/content_policy_update/ctsqobs/). This gap between our content policy and our values has eroded our effectiveness in combating hate and racism on Reddit; I accept full responsibility for this.\n\nThis inconsistency has hurt our trust with our users and moderators and has made us slow to respond to problems. This was also true with r/the_donald, a community that relished in exploiting and detracting from the best of Reddit and that is now nearly disintegrated on their own accord. As we looked to our policies, \u201cBreaking Reddit\u201d was not a sufficient explanation for actioning a political subreddit, and I fear we let being technically correct get in the way of doing the right thing. Clearly, we should have quarantined it sooner.\n\nThe majority of our top communities have a rule banning hate and racism, which makes us proud, and is evidence why a [community-led approach is the only way to scale moderation online](https://docs.house.gov/meetings/IF/IF16/20191016/110075/HHRG-116-IF16-Wstate-HuffmanS-20191016.pdf). That said, this is not a rule communities should have to write for themselves and we need to rebalance the burden of enforcement. I also accept responsibility for this. \n\nDespite making significant progress over the years, we have to turn a mirror on ourselves and be willing to do the hard work of making sure we are living up to our values in our product and policies. This is a significant moment. We have a choice: return to the status quo or use this opportunity for change. We at Reddit are opting for the latter, and we will do our very best to be a part of the progress.\n\nI will be sticking around for a while to answer questions as usual, but I also know that our policies and actions will speak louder than our comments.\n\nThanks,\n\nSteve",

Most of the folks with several-digit lists of subreddits they mod are specialists, and do very little day-to-day modding in those subreddits; how could they?\n\nIn terms of abuse\u2026 We field hundreds of reports about alleged moderator abuse every month as a part of our enforcement of the [Moderator Guidelines](https://www.reddit.com/help/healthycommunities/). The broad majority\u2014more than 99%\u2014are from people who undeniably broke rules, got banned, and held a grudge. A very small number are one-off incidents where mods made a bad choice. And a very, very small sliver are legitimate issues, in which case we reach out and work to resolve these issues\u2014and escalate to actioning the mod team if those efforts fail.\n\nI have lots of ideas (trust me, my team\u2019s ears hurt) about how to improve our governance tools.

We thank Alexis for this meaningful gesture and all that he\u2019s done for us over the years.\n\nAt the risk of making this unreadably long, I'd like to take this moment to share how we got here in the first place, where we have made progress, and where, despite our best intentions, we have fallen short.\n\nIn the early days of Reddit, 2005\u20132006, our idealistic \u201cpolicy\u201d was that, excluding spam, we would not remove content. We were small and did not face many hard decisions. When this ideal was tested, we [banned racist users](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/6m87a/can_we_ban_this_extremely_racist_asshole/c0497kd/?context=3) anyway. In the end, we acted based on our beliefs, despite our \u201cpolicy.\u201d \n\nI left Reddit from 2010\u20132015. During this time, in addition to rapid user growth, Reddit\u2019s no-removal policy [ossified](https://redditblog.com/2014/09/06/every-man-is-responsible-for-his-own-soul/) and its content policy took [no position on hate](https://web.archive.org/web/20150710230652/https://www.reddit.com/rules/). \n\nWhen I returned in 2015, my top priority was creating a content policy to do two things: deal with hateful communities I had been immediately confronted with (like r/CoonTown, which was explicitly designed to spread racist hate) and provide a clear policy of what\u2019s acceptable on Reddit and what\u2019s not. [We banned that community and others](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/3fx2au/content_policy_update/ctsqobs/) because they were \u201cmaking Reddit worse\u201d but were not clear and direct about their role in sowing hate. We crafted our [2015 policy](https://web.archive.org/web/20150806171017/https://www.reddit.com/help/contentpolicy) around behaviors adjacent to hate that were actionable and objective: violence and harassment, because we struggled to create a definition of hate and racism that we could defend and enforce at our scale. Through continual updates to these policies [2017](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/78p7bz/update_on_sitewide_rules_regarding_violent_content/), [2018](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/863xcj/new_addition_to_sitewide_rules_regarding_the_use/), [2019](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/dbf9nj/changes_to_our_policy_against_bullying_and/), [2020](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditsecurity/comments/emd7yx/updates_to_our_policy_around_impersonation/) (and a broader definition of violence), we have removed thousands of hateful communities. \n\nWhile we dealt with many communities themselves, we still did not provide the clarity\u2014and it showed, both in our enforcement and in confusion about where we stand. In 2018, I confusingly said [racism is not against the rules, but also isn\u2019t welcome on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/3fx2au/content_policy_update/ctsqobs/). This gap between our content policy and our values has eroded our effectiveness in combating hate and racism on Reddit; I accept full responsibility for this.\n\nThis inconsistency has hurt our trust with our users and moderators and has made us slow to respond to problems. This was also true with r/the_donald, a community that relished in exploiting and detracting from the best of Reddit and that is now nearly disintegrated on their own accord. As we looked to our policies, \u201cBreaking Reddit\u201d was not a sufficient explanation for actioning a political subreddit, and I fear we let being technically correct get in the way of doing the right thing. Clearly, we should have quarantined it sooner.\n\nThe majority of our top communities have a rule banning hate and racism, which makes us proud, and is evidence why a [community-led approach is the only way to scale moderation online](https://docs.house.gov/meetings/IF/IF16/20191016/110075/HHRG-116-IF16-Wstate-HuffmanS-20191016.pdf). That said, this is not a rule communities should have to write for themselves and we need to rebalance the burden of enforcement. I also accept responsibility for this. \n\nDespite making significant progress over the years, we have to turn a mirror on ourselves and be willing to do the hard work of making sure we are living up to our values in our product and policies. This is a significant moment. We have a choice: return to the status quo or use this opportunity for change. We at Reddit are opting for the latter, and we will do our very best to be a part of the progress.\n\nI will be sticking around for a while to answer questions as usual, but I also know that our policies and actions will speak louder than our comments.\n\nThanks,\n\nSteve",

            "Replying to": "**Open Letter to Steve Huffman and the Board of Directors of Reddit, Inc \u2013 If you believe in standing up to hate and supporting black lives, you need to act**\n\nDear Steve,\n\nOn June 1, you shared a letter on Reddit\u2019s blog  [\u201cRemember the Human \u2013 Black Lives Matter\u201d]( https://redditblog.com/2020/06/01/remember-the-human-black-lives-matter/).  In this letter, you claim \u201cas Snoos, we do not tolerate hate, racism, and violence, and while we have work to do to fight these on our platform, our values are clear.\u201d\n\nAs of today, neither you nor any other Reddit admins have shared this letter anywhere on reddit.com. However, [the response to this message was swift on Twitter](https://twitter.com/reddit/status/1267643352851247106), where you were rightfully labeled as hypocritical based on your long and well-recorded history of defending racism and white supremacy on this site. \n\nAmong the many responses was this message from former CEO of Reddit, Ellen Pao. \n\n>[I am obligated to call you out: You should have shut down the_donald instead of amplifying it and its hate, racism, and violence. So much of what is happening now lies at your feet. You don't get to say BLM when reddit nurtures and monetizes white supremacy and hate all day long](https://twitter.com/ekp/status/1267689503797342208)\n\nMany others shared links and screenshots of your past statements saying [\u201cOpen racism and slurs are fine to post on Reddit\u201d](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/apr/12/racism-slurs-reddit-post-ceo-steve-huffman).\n\nThe problem of Reddit\u2019s leadership supporting and providing a platform for racist users and hateful communities has long been an issue.  Nearly six years ago, [dozens of subreddits signed the original open letter to the Reddit admins](https://www.reddit.com/r/blackladies/comments/2ejg1b/we_have_a_racist_user_problem_and_reddit_wont/) calling for action.  While [the Reddit admins acknowledged the letter](https://www.reddit.com/r/blackladies/comments/2m9k6p/maybe_its_time_to_repost_the_open_letter_reddit/cm27j8j/) and said it was a high priority to address this issue, extremely little has been done in the intervening years.\n\nOn June 5, you shared this update on /r/Announcements, [Upcoming changes to our content policy, our board, and where we\u2019re going from here](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/gxas21/upcoming_changes_to_our_content_policy_our_board/).  In the post, you stated that there is a need for continued adjustments of Reddit\u2019s content policy to address racism and that this remains a priority.  These continued statements that you hear us, that this is a priority, or that you are working on it are not enough.  It has been five years since your return as CEO and this still remains Reddit\u2019s most glaring problem.\n\nSteve, if you and Reddit genuinely care about the values of standing up to racism and hate, then you need to back it up with real action.  As moderators on this website who have dedicated countless hours to keeping this site running, we call on Reddit to take the following steps:\n\n* **Enact a sitewide policy against racism, slurs, and hatespeech targeted at protected groups.** For too many years, Steve Huffman and the other Admins have stood by and allowed this site to fester with hate in the name of \u201cfree speech.\u201d  It is time to enact a specific and detailed policy that protects the disadvantaged members of our communities from hate based on their sexuality, gender identity, ethnicity, country of origin, religion, or disability.\n\n* **Be proactive in banning hate-based communities**  In the past Reddit has only taken action on hate subreddits when they were featured in the news and risked Reddit\u2019s reputation or when they were documented and featured on /r/AgainstHateSubreddits and other forums.  AHS should not have to be responsible for raising awareness of hate subreddits and reporting them to the admins.  This site should take responsibility for keeping its users safe by banning any remaining subreddits devoted to hate and racism and preventing the creation of hateful subreddits in the future. \n\n* **Be proactive in banning hate users** Reddit needs to not only ban hate subreddits, but must be proactive in banning the moderators of these subreddits and their most active users.  Too often these users have been allowed to stay on this website after numerous sitewide violations, letting them move on to participate in new hate communities and spread their vitriol further across this site.\n\n* **Reddit needs to hire more minorities / women, especially in leadership roles** Reddit needs to hire more women and people of color \u2014 particularly in leadership roles in the company \u2014 to help shift the corporate culture and policies to be more equitable for all.  In addition, Reddit needs to take adequate steps to protect these employees from harassment. \n\n* **Reddit needs to hire more community managers** According to Reddit's [job listings](https://www.redditinc.com/careers) there are dozens of open positions that the company is hiring for, and yet not a single one for Community.  Reddit has enacted numerous policies over the years that have been detrimental to the ability of Reddit\u2019s moderators or the broader Reddit community.  Reddit needs more community managers to build positive relations and engagement with the site\u2019s volunteer moderators.\n\n* **Honor Alexis Ohanian's wishes to have his Reddit Board seat filled with a black candidate** - On June 5, Reddit Co-Founder and Executive Chairman [announced that he would be stepping down](https://twitter.com/alexisohanian/status/1268943036228292608) from his role on Reddit's Board of Directors.  Alexis requested that his position be filled with a black candidate and we ask Reddit to honor that request.  While you have stated your intent to honor that request, we are asking for an announcement to be made on this decision in the next 3 months.  We believe this is not an issue that should be put off for action years down the road.\n\nAt /r/AgainstHateSubreddits, we have laid out the many failures of Steve time and again to stand up to white supremacy on this site [time]( https://www.reddit.com/r/AgainstHateSubreddits/comments/gv7mtn/steve_spez_huffman_is_finally_claiming_that_black/) and [time]( https://www.reddit.com/r/AgainstHateSubreddits/comments/a3q6ck/2018_reddit_review_a_year_of_hate_propaganda_and/) and [time]( https://www.reddit.com/r/AgainstHateSubreddits/comments/84q74p/bbc_calls_out_rthe_donald_for_being_a_thriving/) again.\n\nWith a website with the impact of Reddit on the broader conversations being held in communities around the world, this website needs real leadership and real action.\n\nWe hope that Reddit will not just share empty platitudes \u2014 but will take a meaningful stand against hate, and take these recommendations to heart.\n\nThis letter is co-signed by more than ~~200~~ ~~**300**~~ ~~**350**~~ ~~**430**~~ ~~**550**~~ ~~**650**~~ **800** communities representing ~~well over

            "Replying to": "**Open Letter to Steve Huffman and the Board of Directors of Reddit, Inc \u2013 If you believe in standing up to hate and supporting black lives, you need to act**\n\nDear Steve,\n\nOn June 1, you shared a letter on Reddit\u2019s blog  [\u201cRemember the Human \u2013 Black Lives Matter\u201d]( https://redditblog.com/2020/06/01/remember-the-human-black-lives-matter/).  In this letter, you claim \u201cas Snoos, we do not tolerate hate, racism, and violence, and while we have work to do to fight these on our platform, our values are clear.\u201d\n\nAs of today, neither you nor any other Reddit admins have shared this letter anywhere on reddit.com. However, [the response to this message was swift on Twitter](https://twitter.com/reddit/status/1267643352851247106), where you were rightfully labeled as hypocritical based on your long and well-recorded history of defending racism and white supremacy on this site. \n\nAmong the many responses was this message from former CEO of Reddit, Ellen Pao. \n\n>[I am obligated to call you out: You should have shut down the_donald instead of amplifying it and its hate, racism, and violence. So much of what is happening now lies at your feet. You don't get to say BLM when reddit nurtures and monetizes white supremacy and hate all day long](https://twitter.com/ekp/status/1267689503797342208)\n\nMany others shared links and screenshots of your past statements saying [\u201cOpen racism and slurs are fine to post on Reddit\u201d](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/apr/12/racism-slurs-reddit-post-ceo-steve-huffman).\n\nThe problem of Reddit\u2019s leadership supporting and providing a platform for racist users and hateful communities has long been an issue.  Nearly six years ago, [dozens of subreddits signed the original open letter to the Reddit admins](https://www.reddit.com/r/blackladies/comments/2ejg1b/we_have_a_racist_user_problem_and_reddit_wont/) calling for action.  While [the Reddit admins acknowledged the letter](https://www.reddit.com/r/blackladies/comments/2m9k6p/maybe_its_time_to_repost_the_open_letter_reddit/cm27j8j/) and said it was a high priority to address this issue, extremely little has been done in the intervening years.\n\nOn June 5, you shared this update on /r/Announcements, [Upcoming changes to our content policy, our board, and where we\u2019re going from here](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/gxas21/upcoming_changes_to_our_content_policy_our_board/).  In the post, you stated that there is a need for continued adjustments of Reddit\u2019s content policy to address racism and that this remains a priority.  These continued statements that you hear us, that this is a priority, or that you are working on it are not enough.  It has been five years since your return as CEO and this still remains Reddit\u2019s most glaring problem.\n\nSteve, if you and Reddit genuinely care about the values of standing up to racism and hate, then you need to back it up with real action.  As moderators on this website who have dedicated countless hours to keeping this site running, we call on Reddit to take the following steps:\n\n* **Enact a sitewide policy against racism, slurs, and hatespeech targeted at protected groups.** For too many years, Steve Huffman and the other Admins have stood by and allowed this site to fester with hate in the name of \u201cfree speech.\u201d  It is time to enact a specific and detailed policy that protects the disadvantaged members of our communities from hate based on their sexuality, gender identity, ethnicity, country of origin, religion, or disability.\n\n* **Be proactive in banning hate-based communities**  In the past Reddit has only taken action on hate subreddits when they were featured in the news and risked Reddit\u2019s reputation or when they were documented and featured on /r/AgainstHateSubreddits and other forums.  AHS should not have to be responsible for raising awareness of hate subreddits and reporting them to the admins.  This site should take responsibility for keeping its users safe by banning any remaining subreddits devoted to hate and racism and preventing the creation of hateful subreddits in the future. \n\n* **Be proactive in banning hate users** Reddit needs to not only ban hate subreddits, but must be proactive in banning the moderators of these subreddits and their most active users.  Too often these users have been allowed to stay on this website after numerous sitewide violations, letting them move on to participate in new hate communities and spread their vitriol further across this site.\n\n* **Reddit needs to hire more minorities / women, especially in leadership roles** Reddit needs to hire more women and people of color \u2014 particularly in leadership roles in the company \u2014 to help shift the corporate culture and policies to be more equitable for all.  In addition, Reddit needs to take adequate steps to protect these employees from harassment. \n\n* **Reddit needs to hire more community managers** According to Reddit's [job listings](https://www.redditinc.com/careers) there are dozens of open positions that the company is hiring for, and yet not a single one for Community.  Reddit has enacted numerous policies over the years that have been detrimental to the ability of Reddit\u2019s moderators or the broader Reddit community.  Reddit needs more community managers to build positive relations and engagement with the site\u2019s volunteer moderators.\n\n* **Honor Alexis Ohanian's wishes to have his Reddit Board seat filled with a black candidate** - On June 5, Reddit Co-Founder and Executive Chairman [announced that he would be stepping down](https://twitter.com/alexisohanian/status/1268943036228292608) from his role on Reddit's Board of Directors.  Alexis requested that his position be filled with a black candidate and we ask Reddit to honor that request.  While you have stated your intent to honor that request, we are asking for an announcement to be made on this decision in the next 3 months.  We believe this is not an issue that should be put off for action years down the road.\n\nAt /r/AgainstHateSubreddits, we have laid out the many failures of Steve time and again to stand up to white supremacy on this site [time]( https://www.reddit.com/r/AgainstHateSubreddits/comments/gv7mtn/steve_spez_huffman_is_finally_claiming_that_black/) and [time]( https://www.reddit.com/r/AgainstHateSubreddits/comments/a3q6ck/2018_reddit_review_a_year_of_hate_propaganda_and/) and [time]( https://www.reddit.com/r/AgainstHateSubreddits/comments/84q74p/bbc_calls_out_rthe_donald_for_being_a_thriving/) again.\n\nWith a website with the impact of Reddit on the broader conversations being held in communities around the world, this website needs real leadership and real action.\n\nWe hope that Reddit will not just share empty platitudes \u2014 but will take a meaningful stand against hate, and take these recommendations to heart.\n\nThis letter is co-signed by more than ~~200~~ ~~**300**~~ ~~**350**~~ ~~**430**~~ ~~**550**~~ ~~**650**~~ **800** communities representing ~~well over

            "Replying to": "**TL;DR: We\u2019re working with mods to change our content policy to explicitly address hate.** u/kn0thing **has resigned from our board to fill his seat with a Black candidate, a request we will honor. I want to take responsibility for the history of our policies over the years that got us here, and we still have work to do.**\n\nAfter watching people across the country mourn and demand an end to centuries of murder and violent discrimination against Black people, I wanted to speak out. I wanted to do this both as a human being, who sees this grief and pain and knows I have been spared from it myself because of the color of my skin, and as someone who literally has a platform and, with it, a duty to speak out.\n\nEarlier this week, I wrote an email to our company addressing this crisis and a few ways Reddit will respond. When we shared it, many of the responses said something like, \u201cHow can a company that has faced racism from users on its own platform over the years credibly take such a position?\u201d\n\nThese questions, which I know are coming from a place of real pain and which I take to heart, are really a statement: There is an unacceptable gap between our beliefs as people and a company, and what you see in our content policy. \n\nOver the last fifteen years, hundreds of millions of people have come to Reddit for things that I believe are fundamentally good: user-driven communities\u2014across a wider spectrum of interests and passions than I could\u2019ve imagined when we first created subreddits\u2014and the kinds of content and conversations that keep people coming back day after day. It's why we come to Reddit as users, as mods, and as employees who want to bring this sort of community and belonging to the world and make it better daily.\n\nHowever, as Reddit has grown, alongside much good, it is facing its own challenges around hate and racism. We have to acknowledge and accept responsibility for the role we have played. Here are three problems we are most focused on:\n\n* Parts of Reddit reflect an unflattering but real resemblance to the world in the hate that Black users and communities see daily, despite the progress we have made in improving our tooling and enforcement. \n* Users and moderators genuinely do not have enough clarity as to where we as administrators stand on racism. \n* Our moderators are frustrated and need a real seat at the table to help shape the policies that they help us enforce.\n\nWe are already working to fix these problems, and this is a promise for more urgency. Our current [content policy](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy) is effectively nine rules for what you cannot do on Reddit. In many respects, it\u2019s served us well. Under it, we have made meaningful progress cleaning up the platform (and done so without undermining the free expression and authenticity that fuels Reddit). That said, we still have work to do. This current policy lists only what you cannot do, articulates none of the values behind the rules, and does not explicitly take a stance on hate or racism.\n\nWe will update our content policy to include a vision for Reddit and its communities to aspire to, a statement on hate, the context for the rules, and a principle that Reddit isn\u2019t to be used as a weapon. We have details to work through, and while we will move quickly, I do want to be thoughtful and also gather feedback from our moderators (through our Mod Councils). With more moderator engagement, the timeline is weeks, not months.\n\nAnd just this morning, Alexis Ohanian (u/kn0thing), my Reddit cofounder, announced that he is resigning from our board and that he wishes for his seat to be filled with a Black candidate, a request that the board and I will honor. We thank Alexis for this meaningful gesture and all that he\u2019s done for us over the years.\n\nAt the risk of making this unreadably long, I'd like to take this moment to share how we got here in the first place, where we have made progress, and where, despite our best intentions, we have fallen short.\n\nIn the early days of Reddit, 2005\u20132006, our idealistic \u201cpolicy\u201d was that, excluding spam, we would not remove content. We were small and did not face many hard decisions. When this ideal was tested, we [banned racist users](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/6m87a/can_we_ban_this_extremely_racist_asshole/c0497kd/?context=3) anyway. In the end, we acted based on our beliefs, despite our \u201cpolicy.\u201d \n\nI left Reddit from 2010\u20132015. During this time, in addition to rapid user growth, Reddit\u2019s no-removal policy [ossified](https://redditblog.com/2014/09/06/every-man-is-responsible-for-his-own-soul/) and its content policy took [no position on hate](https://web.archive.org/web/20150710230652/https://www.reddit.com/rules/). \n\nWhen I returned in 2015, my top priority was creating a content policy to do two things: deal with hateful communities I had been immediately confronted with (like r/CoonTown, which was explicitly designed to spread racist hate) and provide a clear policy of what\u2019s acceptable on Reddit and what\u2019s not. [We banned that community and others](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/3fx2au/content_policy_update/ctsqobs/) because they were \u201cmaking Reddit worse\u201d but were not clear and direct about their role in sowing hate. We crafted our [2015 policy](https://web.archive.org/web/20150806171017/https://www.reddit.com/help/contentpolicy) around behaviors adjacent to hate that were actionable and objective: violence and harassment, because we struggled to create a definition of hate and racism that we could defend and enforce at our scale. Through continual updates to these policies [2017](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/78p7bz/update_on_sitewide_rules_regarding_violent_content/), [2018](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/863xcj/new_addition_to_sitewide_rules_regarding_the_use/), [2019](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/dbf9nj/changes_to_our_policy_against_bullying_and/), [2020](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditsecurity/comments/emd7yx/updates_to_our_policy_around_impersonation/) (and a broader definition of violence), we have removed thousands of hateful communities. \n\nWhile we dealt with many communities themselves, we still did not provide the clarity\u2014and it showed, both in our enforcement and in confusion about where we stand. In 2018, I confusingly said [racism is not against the rules, but also isn\u2019t welcome on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/3fx2au/content_policy_update/ctsqobs/). This gap between our content policy and our values has eroded our effectiveness in combating hate and racism on Reddit; I accept full responsibility for this.\n\nThis inconsistency has hurt our trust with our users and moderators and has made us slow to respond to problems. This was also true with r/the_donald, a community that relished in exploiting and detracting from the best of Reddit and that is now nearly disintegrated on their own accord. As we looked to our policies, \u201cBreaking Reddit\u201d was not a sufficient explanation for actioning a political subreddit, and I fear we let being technically correct get in the way of doing the right thing. Clearly, we should have quarantined it sooner.\n\nThe majority of our top communities have a rule banning hate and racism, which makes us proud, and is evidence why a [community-led approach is the only way to scale moderation online](https://docs.house.gov/meetings/IF/IF16/20191016/110075/HHRG-116-IF16-Wstate-HuffmanS-20191016.pdf). That said, this is not a rule communities should have to write for themselves and we need to rebalance the burden of enforcement. I also accept responsibility for this. \n\nDespite making significant progress over the years, we have to turn a mirror on ourselves and be willing to do the hard work of making sure we are living up to our values in our product and policies. This is a significant moment. We have a choice: return to the status quo or use this opportunity for change. We at Reddit are opting for the latter, and we will do our very best to be a part of the progress.\n\nI will be sticking around for a while to answer questions as usual, but I also know that our policies and actions will speak louder than our comments.\n\nThanks,\n\nSteve",

Our current [content policy](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy) is effectively nine rules for what you cannot do on Reddit. In many respects, it\u2019s served us well. Under it, we have made meaningful progress cleaning up the platform (and done so without undermining the free expression and authenticity that fuels Reddit). That said, we still have work to do. This current policy lists only what you cannot do, articulates none of the values behind the rules, and does not explicitly take a stance on hate or racism.\n\nWe will update our content policy to include a vision for Reddit and its communities to aspire to, a statement on hate, the context for the rules, and a principle that Reddit isn\u2019t to be used as a weapon. We have details to work through, and while we will move quickly, I do want to be thoughtful and also gather feedback from our moderators (through our Mod Councils). With more moderator engagement, the timeline is weeks, not months.\n\nAnd just this morning, Alexis Ohanian (u/kn0thing), my Reddit cofounder, announced that he is resigning from our board and that he wishes for his seat to be filled with a Black candidate, a request that the board and I will honor. We thank Alexis for this meaningful gesture and all that he\u2019s done for us over the years.\n\nAt the risk of making this unreadably long, I'd like to take this moment to share how we got here in the first place, where we have made progress, and where, despite our best intentions, we have fallen short.\n\nIn the early days of Reddit, 2005\u20132006, our idealistic \u201cpolicy\u201d was that, excluding spam, we would not remove content. We were small and did not face many hard decisions. When this ideal was tested, we [banned racist users](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/6m87a/can_we_ban_this_extremely_racist_asshole/c0497kd/?context=3) anyway. In the end, we acted based on our beliefs, despite our \u201cpolicy.\u201d \n\nI left Reddit from 2010\u20132015. During this time, in addition to rapid user growth, Reddit\u2019s no-removal policy [ossified](https://redditblog.com/2014/09/06/every-man-is-responsible-for-his-own-soul/) and its content policy took [no position on hate](https://web.archive.org/web/20150710230652/https://www.reddit.com/rules/). \n\nWhen I returned in 2015, my top priority was creating a content policy to do two things: deal with hateful communities I had been immediately confronted with (like r/CoonTown, which was explicitly designed to spread racist hate) and provide a clear policy of what\u2019s acceptable on Reddit and what\u2019s not. [We banned that community and others](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/3fx2au/content_policy_update/ctsqobs/) because they were \u201cmaking Reddit worse\u201d but were not clear and direct about their role in sowing hate. We crafted our [2015 policy](https://web.archive.org/web/20150806171017/https://www.reddit.com/help/contentpolicy) around behaviors adjacent to hate that were actionable and objective: violence and harassment, because we struggled to create a definition of hate and racism that we could defend and enforce at our scale. Through continual updates to these policies [2017](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/78p7bz/update_on_sitewide_rules_regarding_violent_content/), [2018](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/863xcj/new_addition_to_sitewide_rules_regarding_the_use/), [2019](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/dbf9nj/changes_to_our_policy_against_bullying_and/), [2020](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditsecurity/comments/emd7yx/updates_to_our_policy_around_impersonation/) (and a broader definition of violence), we have removed thousands of hateful communities. \n\nWhile we dealt with many communities themselves, we still did not provide the clarity\u2014and it showed, both in our enforcement and in confusion about where we stand. In 2018, I confusingly said [racism is not against the rules, but also isn\u2019t welcome on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/3fx2au/content_policy_update/ctsqobs/). This gap between our content policy and our values has eroded our effectiveness in combating hate and racism on Reddit; I accept full responsibility for this.\n\nThis inconsistency has hurt our trust with our users and moderators and has made us slow to respond to problems. This was also true with r/the_donald, a community that relished in exploiting and detracting from the best of Reddit and that is now nearly disintegrated on their own accord. As we looked to our policies, \u201cBreaking Reddit\u201d was not a sufficient explanation for actioning a political subreddit, and I fear we let being technically correct get in the way of doing the right thing. Clearly, we should have quarantined it sooner.\n\nThe majority of our top communities have a rule banning hate and racism, which makes us proud, and is evidence why a [community-led approach is the only way to scale moderation online](https://docs.house.gov/meetings/IF/IF16/20191016/110075/HHRG-116-IF16-Wstate-HuffmanS-20191016.pdf). That said, this is not a rule communities should have to write for themselves and we need to rebalance the burden of enforcement. I also accept responsibility for this. \n\nDespite making significant progress over the years, we have to turn a mirror on ourselves and be willing to do the hard work of making sure we are living up to our values in our product and policies. This is a significant moment. We have a choice: return to the status quo or use this opportunity for change. We at Reddit are opting for the latter, and we will do our very best to be a part of the progress.\n\nI will be sticking around for a while to answer questions as usual, but I also know that our policies and actions will speak louder than our comments.\n\nThanks,\n\nSteve",

Our top priority at reddit is to develop a comprehensive Content Policy and the tools to enforce it.\n\nThe overwhelming majority of content on reddit comes from wonderful, creative, funny, smart, and silly communities. That is what makes reddit great. There is also a dark side, communities whose purpose is reprehensible, and we don\u2019t have any obligation to support them. And we also believe that some communities currently on the platform should not be here at all.\n\nNeither Alexis nor I created reddit to be a bastion of free speech, but rather as a place where open and honest discussion can happen:  These are very complicated issues, and we are putting a lot of thought into it. It\u2019s something we\u2019ve been thinking about for quite some time.  We haven\u2019t had the tools to enforce policy, but now we\u2019re building those tools and reevaluating our policy.\n\nWe as a community need to decide together what our values are. To that end, I\u2019ll be hosting an AMA on Thursday 1pm pst to present our current thinking to you, the community, and solicit your feedback.\n\nPS - I won\u2019t be able to hang out in comments right now.

            "Body": "Hi All,\n\nWhat happened in Orlando this weekend was a national tragedy. Let\u2019s remember that first and foremost, this was a devastating and visceral human experience that many individuals and whole communities were, and continue to be, affected by. In the grand scheme of things, this is what is most important today.\n\nI would like to address what happened on Reddit this past weekend. Many of you use Reddit as your primary source of news, and we have a duty to provide access to timely information during a crisis. This is a responsibility we take seriously.\n\nThe story broke on r/news, as is common. In such situations, their community is flooded with all manners of posts. Their policy includes removing duplicate posts to focus the conversation in one place, and removing speculative posts until facts are established. A few posts were removed incorrectly, which have now been restored. One moderator did cross the line with their behavior, and is no longer a part of the team. We have seen the accusations of censorship. We have investigated, and beyond the posts that are now restored, have not found evidence to support these claims.\n\nWhether you agree with r/news\u2019 policies or not, it is never acceptable to harass users or moderators. Expressing your anger is fine. Sending death threats is not. We will be taking action against users, moderators, posts, and communities that encourage such behavior.\n\nWe are working with r/news to understand the challenges faced and their actions taken throughout, and we will work more closely with moderators of large communities in future times of crisis. We\u2013Reddit Inc, moderators, and users\u2013all have a duty to ensure access to timely information is available.\n\nIn the wake of this weekend, we will be making a handful of technology and process changes:\n\n* Live threads are the best place for news to break and for the community to stay updated on the events. We are working to make this more timely, evident, and organized.\n* [We\u2019re introducing a change to Sticky Posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/changelog/comments/4ny8y6/renaming_sticky_posts_to_announcements/): They\u2019ll now be called Announcement Posts, which better captures their intended purpose; they will only be able to be created by moderators; and they must be text posts. Votes will continue to count. We are making this change to prevent the use of Sticky Posts to organize bad behavior.\n* We are working on a change to the r/all algorithm to promote more diversity in the feed, which will help provide more variety of viewpoints and prevent vote manipulation.\n* We are nearly fully staffed on our Community team, and will continue increasing support for moderator teams of major communities.\n\nAgain, what happened in Orlando is horrible, and above all, we need to keep things in perspective. We\u2019ve all been set back by the events, but we will move forward together to do better next time. "

            "Replying to": "**TL;DR: Today we published our 2019** [**Transparency Report**](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/transparency-report-2019)**. I\u2019ll stick around to answer your questions about the report (and other topics) in the comments.**\n\nHi all,\n\nIt\u2019s that time of year again when we share Reddit\u2019s annual transparency report.\n\nWe share this report each year because you have a right to know how user data is being managed by Reddit, and how it\u2019s both shared and not shared with government and non-government parties.\n\nYou\u2019ll find information on content removed from Reddit and requests for user information. This year, we\u2019ve expanded the report to include new data\u2014specifically, a breakdown of content policy removals, content manipulation removals, subreddit removals, and subreddit quarantines.\n\n## By the numbers\n\nSince the [full report](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/transparency-report-2019) is rather long, I\u2019ll call out a few stats below:\n\n**ADMIN REMOVALS**\n\n* In 2019, we removed **\\~53M** pieces of content in total, mostly for spam and content manipulation (e.g. brigading and vote cheating), exclusive of legal/copyright removals, which we track separately.\n* For [Content Policy](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy) violations, we removed\n   * **222k** **pieces of content**,\n   * **55.9k accounts**, and\n   * **21.9k** **subreddits** (**87%** of which were removed for being unmoderated).\n* Additionally, we quarantined **256 subreddits**.\n\n**LEGAL REMOVALS**\n\n* Reddit received **110 requests** from government entities to remove content, of which we complied with **37.3%**.\n* In 2019 we removed about **5x more** content for copyright infringement than in 2018, largely due to copyright notices for adult-entertainment and notices targeting pieces of content that had already been removed.\n\n**REQUESTS FOR USER INFORMATION**\n\n* We received a total of **772 requests** for user account information from law enforcement and government entities.\n   * **366** of these were emergency disclosure requests, mostly from US law enforcement (**68%** of which we complied with).\n   * **406** were non-emergency requests (**73%** of which we complied with); most were US subpoenas.\n   * Reddit received an additional **224 requests** to temporarily preserve certain user account information (**86%** of which we complied with).\n* Note: We carefully review each request for compliance with applicable laws and regulations. If we determine that a request is not legally valid, Reddit will challenge or reject it. (You can read more in our [Privacy Policy](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/privacy-policy) and [Guidelines for Law Enforcement](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/guidelines-for-law-enforcement).)\n\n## While I have your attention...\n\nI\u2019d like to share an update about our thinking around quarantined communities.\n\nWhen we [expanded our quarantine policy](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/9jf8nh/revamping_the_quarantine_function/), we created an appeals process for sanctioned communities. One of the goals was to \u201cforce subscribers to reconsider their behavior and incentivize moderators to make changes.\u201d While the policy attempted to hold moderators more accountable for enforcing healthier rules and norms, it didn\u2019t address the role that each member plays in the health of their community.\n\nToday, we\u2019re making an update to address this gap: Users who consistently upvote policy-breaking content within quarantined communities will receive automated warnings, followed by further consequences like a temporary or permanent suspension. We hope this will encourage healthier behavior across these communities.\n\n## If you\u2019ve read this far\n\nIn addition to this report, we share news throughout the year from teams across Reddit, and if you like posts about what we\u2019re doing, you can stay up to date and talk to our teams in r/RedditSecurity, r/ModNews, r/redditmobile, and r/changelog.\n\n**As usual, I\u2019ll be sticking around to answer your questions in the comments. AMA.**\n\nUpdate: I'm off for now. Thanks for questions, everyone.",

Both our [iPhone](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/reddit-the-official-app/id1064216828?mt=8) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.reddit.frontpage&hl=en) apps have had [multiple releases](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditmobile), and we\u2019re proud at how well they are progressing. Mobile web (m.reddit.com) is undergoing a major overhaul that we\u2019re testing internally, and hope to start showing to users in the next couple weeks. We have been running many experiments on desktop web to increase user engagement, particularly for users who are new to Reddit. You can see what experiments we are running on this [live thread](https://www.reddit.com/live/x3ckzbsj6myw/), and notable changes to the site are listed in r/changelog.\n\nWe\u2019ve started development on a new frontpage algorithm. The current algorithm is outdated and is no longer meeting our needs. There are a number of problems we\u2019d like to solve: increased velocity, improved personalization, reduced dependence on /new, and not requiring us to choose the defaults. We\u2019re still in the early days, but I\u2019m happy we\u2019re dedicating resources to it.\n\nAs it relates to monetization, we\u2019ve made a handful of changes: we [tested adding affiliate tags](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/4mv578/affiliate_links_on_reddit/) to e-commerce links, which we ended up turning off; we announced [Promoted User Posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/4upf11/new_ad_type_promoted_user_posts/); and we announced [tests we\u2019ll be running](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/4phzsi/sponsored_headline_tests_placement_and_design/) on sponsored headlines. Changes and additions to ads can be met with skepticism, and this is why we test changes carefully and listen to feedback. As we evolve our ads platform, we are working to do it in a way that that complements the core experience and engages redditors. These changes and experiments will continue to happen, but while it is critical that we build Reddit into a sustainable business, we don\u2019t want to compromise what\u2019s brought us here. Going forward, we will list these in r/changelog so all these kinds of announcements are in one place.\n\nYesterday, we previewed [new moderator mail](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/4wwzzs/new_modmail_a_demo_and_a_call_for_beta_testers/) to moderators. This has been a long time coming, and we\u2019re excited to show it off. The current moderator mail system is a hack on top of our messaging system, which is itself a hack on top of our commenting system. The new tool should save a lot of time for everyone, and new tech stack will allow for better future iterations and builds. We\u2019ll be working with moderators to refine it while we work towards a full rollout.\n\nWe\u2019ve seen great results from our Anti-Evil, Trust & Safety, and Community teams. The mandate of these teams is to eliminate spam and abuse and to ensure Reddit is a welcoming place for all. In the last quarter, we\u2019ve reduced harassment reports by 15%, spam reports by 66%, and moderator spam removals by 15%. We\u2019ve also reduced our support ticket backlog substantially, dropping our average response time from 64 hours to 7 in the process.\n\nHappy to chat about this stuff, or anything else.\n\ne: grammar\n\nu: Thank you! Heading out for now. Will check back later."

Nevertheless, we will continue to fight for the open internet (and occasionally pester you with posts encouraging you to fight for it, too).\n\nWe also had a lot of fun fighting for the *not-so-free* but perfectly balanced world of r/thanosdidnothingwrong. I\u2019m always amazed to see redditors so engaged with their communities that they get [Snoo tattoos](https://www.reddit.com/r/thanosdidnothingwrong/comments/8zcga8/perfectly_balanced_as_all_things_should_be/). \n\nSpeaking of bans, you\u2019ve probably noticed that over the past few months we\u2019ve banned a few subreddits and [quarantined](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/9jf8nh/revamping_the_quarantine_function/) several more. We don't take the banning of subreddits lightly, but we will continue to enforce our policies (and be transparent with all of you when we make changes to them) and use other tools to encourage a healthy ecosystem for communities. We\u2019ve been investing heavily in our Anti-Evil and Trust & Safety teams, as well as a new team devoted solely to investigating and preventing efforts to interfere with our site, state-sponsored and otherwise. We also recognize the ways that redditors themselves actively help flag potential suspicious actors, and we\u2019re working on a system to allow you all to [report directly to this team](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModSupport/comments/9hjkv5/so_about_those_suspicious_activity_reports/).\n\nOn the product side, our teams have been hard at work shipping countless updates to our [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/reddit-the-official-app/id1064216828?mt=8) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=reddit+Inc.&hl=en) apps, like universal search and News. We\u2019ve also expanded Chat on mobile and desktop and launched an opt-in subreddit chat, which we\u2019ve already seen communities using for game-day discussions and chats about TV shows. We started testing out a new hub for [OC (Original Content)](https://www.reddit.com/original) and a [Save Drafts feature](https://www.reddit.com/r/redesign/comments/8k8d1x/beta_new_save_draft_feature_for_text_and_link/) (with shared drafts as well) for text and link posts in the redesign. \n\nSpeaking of which, we\u2019ve made a ton of improvements to the redesign since we last talked about it in April. \n\nIncluding but not limited to\u2026 night mode, user & post flair improvements, [better traffic pages for ](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/954a8p/traffic_page_update_see_your_subreddits_traffic/)\n\n[mods](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/954a8p/traffic_page_update_see_your_subreddits_traffic/), accessibility improvements, keyboard shortcuts, a bunch of new community widgets, fixing key AutoMod integrations, and the ability to [have community styling show up on mobile as well](https://i.redd.it/l12cv7lqmwf11.png), which was one of the main reasons why we took on the redesign in the first place. I know you all have had a lot of feedback since we first launched it ([I have too](https://www.reddit.com/r/redesign/comments/8d8qws/despite_everyone_saying_the_redesign_is_perfect/)). Our teams have poured a tremendous amount of work into shipping improvements, and their #1 focus now is on improving performance. If you haven\u2019t checked it out in a while, I encourage you to [give it a spin](http://new.reddit.com/).\n\nLast but not least, on the community front, we just wrapped our second annual Moderator Thank You Roadshow, where the rest of the admins and I got the chance to meet mods in different cities, have [a bit of fun](https://www.reddit.com/r/boston/comments/8u5cca/quick_while_we_are_all_at_the_game/), and chat about Reddit. We also launched a new [Mod Help Center](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/9bnj3a/we_launched_a_new_knowledge_base_for_mods_and_we/) and new mod tools for Chat and the redesign, with more fun stuff (like Modmail Search) on the way.\n\nOther than that, I can\u2019t imagine we have much to talk about, but I\u2019ll hang to around some questions anyway.\n\n\u2014spez",

It\u2019s also possible that Congress can decide to take up the cause and create strong, enforceable net neutrality rules that aren\u2019t subject to the political winds at the FCC. Nevertheless, this will be a complex process that takes time.\n\nWhat is certain is that Reddit will continue to be involved in this issue in the way that we know best: seeking out every opportunity to amplify your voices and share them with those who have the power to make a difference. \n\nThis isn\u2019t the outcome we wanted, but you should all be proud of the awareness you\u2019ve created.

We'll be doing the same. Keep it up, we're being heard!\n\n*****\n\nHi All,\n\nIf you spent any time on Reddit last week, you [may have noticed a common theme](https://i.redditmedia.com/IhvWlif94HFLCRp0uNqDNjOEsSn2IdI6NVm-OaNnYvM.png?s=2fe8fbb8cd76df11a24f8a105e8a8fae) in the posts on your front page, so we wanted to take a moment to recap what\u2019s happened so far in the fight for net neutrality, underscore how important this issue is to Reddit, and share how we plan to continue to stand up for an internet that remains open and free.\n\nOn Tuesday, FCC chairman Ajit Pai [announced his intention to vote on a full rollback of the 2015 net neutrality rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/7ej943/fcc_announces_plan_to_repeal_net_neutrality/). While the pre-Thanksgiving timing of the announcement might have helped the news sneak by over the holidays, you all have helped prevent that from happening. Aside from ensuring that net neutrality was discussed IRL around Thanksgiving tables across the country, you brought the conversation about the open internet to almost every community on the site, from r/dataisbeautiful to r/trashpandas. You\u2019ve made [high-quality gifs](https://www.reddit.com/r/HighQualityGifs/comments/7eklnu/when_i_hear_net_neutrality_is_under_fire_again/), flooded [the meme market](https://www.reddit.com/r/MemeEconomy/comments/7eqxtf/ea_memes_and_fcc_memes_have_a_quick_return_of/), explained the issue to people who are [out of the loop](https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/7elxew/whats_going_on_with_net_neutrality_ask_all_your/), and [given a history](https://www.reddit.com/r/bestof/comments/7elqw7/redditor_lists_all_the_times_ipss_have_illegally/) of why net neutrality rules are essential. \n\nIn just one week, you made 50,000 unique posts and over 350,000 comments related to net neutrality, generating over 21 million votes. While Tuesday\u2019s news hits close to home, we are grateful that the Reddit community cares just as much about net neutrality as we do at Reddit HQ.\n\nAs many of you know, the FCC\u2019s vote will happen on December 14 and is expected to pass. However, the vote is also expected to be challenged almost immediately in court, likely kicking off a long process that will take years to work through. During this time, Congress will likely try to legislate a fix. As a still-small company that owes its existence to net neutrality\u2019s giving us a fair chance in the marketplace, we will take every opportunity to share our perspective and give constructive input to this process. The [data says](https://www.scribd.com/document/353285485/Freedman-Consulting-Net-Neutrality-Poll) that Americans don\u2019t see this as a partisan issue, and neither do we.\n\nMost of the activism right now is focused on driving messages to Congress and the FCC before December 14 \\(including a protest in DC the day before the vote\\).  The FCC has received a record 22 million comments on net neutrality but has indicated they have not reviewed comments that don\u2019t introduce new facts into the record or make serious legal arguments. Additionally, they believe a number of the comments are fake. While we are unlikely to change the FCC\u2019s decision, we encourage you to follow [Commissioner Rosenworcel\u2019s suggestion](http://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-rosenworcel-fcc-net-neutrality-repeal-20171122-story.html) and continue to \u201cmake a ruckus\u201d to let the FCC hear your individual stories on the importance of net neutrality.  \n\nA few months ago, u/kn0thing [asked you to leave comments explaining why net neutrality is important to you](https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/6mtgtp/we_need_your_voice_as_we_continue_the_fight_for/), and thousands of you delivered. Today, we\u2019re asking you again to leave personal stories that we can use in the battle ahead. When we shared these stories with members of Congress this past July, we saw firsthand how effective they are at humanizing an issue that is too often perceived as an abstract battle between big corporate interests. \n\nWe will continue to share these personal testimonials with more members of Congress, with the media, and potentially file them in court briefs. Our goal in this effort is to keep the personal dimension of the open internet top of mind for everyone who wants to repeal net neutrality. We know how powerful redditors banding together for a common cause can be, so our focus will continue to be on amplifying *your* voices, from Capitol Hill to \u2014 if it comes to it \u2014 the Supreme Court. \n\nSo, please tell us in the comments:\n\n*How would your life change if internet service providers started blocking or throttling certain internet traffic, or creating paid prioritization channels for certain content?* \n\nInclude as much detail as you feel comfortable sharing. Generally, the more specific, the better. Mentioning your state and Congressional representative is especially useful.\n\nThank you.\n\nu/ArabScarab \\(Jessica Ashooh, our Head of Policy\\), and I will hang around to answer questions."

We are taking a more aggressive stance against toxic users and poorly behaving communities. You can filter r/all now.\n\nHi All,\n\nI am sorry: I am sorry for compromising the trust you all have in Reddit, and I am sorry to those that I created work and stress for, particularly over the holidays. It is heartbreaking to think that my actions distracted people from their family over the holiday; instigated harassment of our moderators; and may have harmed Reddit itself, which I love more than just about anything.\n\nThe United States is more divided than ever, and we see that tension within Reddit itself. The community that was formed in support of President-elect Donald Trump organized and grew rapidly, but within it were users that devoted themselves to antagonising the broader Reddit community.\n\nMany of you are aware of my attempt to [troll the trolls](https://www.reddit.com/r/HighQualityGifs/comments/5eo8rq/the_donald_gets_infiltrated_by_reddits_ceo/?st=IVWNCVHU&sh=a9c7a036) last week. I honestly thought I might find some common ground with that community by meeting them on their level. It did not go as planned. I restored the original comments after less than an hour, and [explained what I did](https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/5ekdy9/the_admins_are_suffering_from_low_energy_have/dad5sf1/).\n\nI spent my formative years as a young troll on the Internet. I also led the team that built Reddit ten years ago, and spent years moderating the original Reddit communities, so I am as comfortable online as anyone. As CEO, I am often out in the world speaking about how Reddit is the home to conversation online, and a follow on question about harassment on our site is always asked. We have dedicated many of our resources to fighting harassment on Reddit, which is why letting one of our most engaged communities openly harass me felt hypocritical.\n\nWhile many users across the site found what I did funny, or appreciated that I was standing up to the bullies (I received plenty of support from users of r/the_donald), many others did not. I understand what I did has greater implications than my relationship with one community, and it is fair to raise the question of whether this erodes trust in Reddit. I hope our transparency around this event is an indication that we take matters of trust seriously. Reddit is no longer the little website my college roommate, u/kn0thing, and I started more than eleven years ago. It is a massive collection of communities that provides news, entertainment, and fulfillment for millions of people around the world, and I am continually humbled by what Reddit has grown into. I will never risk your trust like this again, and we are updating our internal controls to prevent this sort of thing from happening in the future.\n\nMore than anything, I want Reddit to heal, and I want our country to heal, and although many of you have asked us to ban the r/the_donald outright, it is with this spirit of healing that I have resisted doing so. If there is anything about this election that we have learned, it is that there are communities that feel alienated and just want to be heard, and Reddit has always been a place where those voices can be heard.\n\nHowever, when we separate the behavior of some of r/the_donald users from their politics, it is their behavior we cannot tolerate. The opening statement of our [Content Policy](https://www.reddit.com/help/contentpolicy) asks that we all show enough respect to others so that we all may continue to enjoy Reddit for what it is. It is my first duty to do what is best for Reddit, and the current situation is not sustainable.\n\nHistorically, we have relied on our relationship with moderators to curb bad behaviors. While some of the moderators have been helpful, this has not been wholly effective, and we are now taking a more proactive approach to policing behavior that is detrimental to Reddit:\n\n* We have identified hundreds of the most toxic users and are taking action against them, ranging from warnings to timeouts to permanent bans.\nPosts stickied on r/the_donald will no longer appear in r/all. r/all is not our frontpage, but is a popular listing that our most engaged users frequent, including myself. The sticky feature was designed for moderators to make announcements or highlight specific posts. It was not meant to circumvent organic voting, which r/the_donald does to slingshot posts into r/all, often in a manner that is antagonistic to the rest of the community.\n\n* We will continue taking on the most troublesome users, and going forward, if we do not see the situation improve, we will continue to take privileges from communities whose users continually cross the line\u2014up to an outright ban.\n\nAgain, I am sorry for the trouble I have caused. While I intended no harm, that was not the result, and I hope these changes improve your experience on Reddit.\n\nSteve\n\nPS: As a bonus, I have enabled filtering for r/all for all users. You can modify the filters by [visiting r/all on the desktop web](https://g.redditmedia.com/34sCU-v1SO7xXrFliAOHfMR2bVjuoC2xYPV3OnH6C9Y.gif?w=1024&fm=mp4&mp4-fragmented=false&s=c4127836f34b00ac6a66b1b429e02440) (I\u2019m old, sorry), but it will affect all platforms, including our native apps on iOS and Android.\n"

I want to take responsibility for the history of our policies over the years that got us here, and we still have work to do.**\n\nAfter watching people across the country mourn and demand an end to centuries of murder and violent discrimination against Black people, I wanted to speak out. I wanted to do this both as a human being, who sees this grief and pain and knows I have been spared from it myself because of the color of my skin, and as someone who literally has a platform and, with it, a duty to speak out.\n\nEarlier this week, I wrote an email to our company addressing this crisis and a few ways Reddit will respond. When we shared it, many of the responses said something like, \u201cHow can a company that has faced racism from users on its own platform over the years credibly take such a position?\u201d\n\nThese questions, which I know are coming from a place of real pain and which I take to heart, are really a statement: There is an unacceptable gap between our beliefs as people and a company, and what you see in our content policy. \n\nOver the last fifteen years, hundreds of millions of people have come to Reddit for things that I believe are fundamentally good: user-driven communities\u2014across a wider spectrum of interests and passions than I could\u2019ve imagined when we first created subreddits\u2014and the kinds of content and conversations that keep people coming back day after day. It's why we come to Reddit as users, as mods, and as employees who want to bring this sort of community and belonging to the world and make it better daily.\n\nHowever, as Reddit has grown, alongside much good, it is facing its own challenges around hate and racism. We have to acknowledge and accept responsibility for the role we have played. Here are three problems we are most focused on:\n\n* Parts of Reddit reflect an unflattering but real resemblance to the world in the hate that Black users and communities see daily, despite the progress we have made in improving our tooling and enforcement. \n* Users and moderators genuinely do not have enough clarity as to where we as administrators stand on racism. \n* Our moderators are frustrated and need a real seat at the table to help shape the policies that they help us enforce.\n\nWe are already working to fix these problems, and this is a promise for more urgency. Our current [content policy](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy) is effectively nine rules for what you cannot do on Reddit. In many respects, it\u2019s served us well. Under it, we have made meaningful progress cleaning up the platform (and done so without undermining the free expression and authenticity that fuels Reddit). That said, we still have work to do. This current policy lists only what you cannot do, articulates none of the values behind the rules, and does not explicitly take a stance on hate or racism.\n\nWe will update our content policy to include a vision for Reddit and its communities to aspire to, a statement on hate, the context for the rules, and a principle that Reddit isn\u2019t to be used as a weapon. We have details to work through, and while we will move quickly, I do want to be thoughtful and also gather feedback from our moderators (through our Mod Councils). With more moderator engagement, the timeline is weeks, not months.\n\nAnd just this morning, Alexis Ohanian (u/kn0thing), my Reddit cofounder, announced that he is resigning from our board and that he wishes for his seat to be filled with a Black candidate, a request that the board and I will honor. We thank Alexis for this meaningful gesture and all that he\u2019s done for us over the years.\n\nAt the risk of making this unreadably long, I'd like to take this moment to share how we got here in the first place, where we have made progress, and where, despite our best intentions, we have fallen short.\n\nIn the early days of Reddit, 2005\u20132006, our idealistic \u201cpolicy\u201d was that, excluding spam, we would not remove content. We were small and did not face many hard decisions. When this ideal was tested, we [banned racist users](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/6m87a/can_we_ban_this_extremely_racist_asshole/c0497kd/?context=3) anyway. In the end, we acted based on our beliefs, despite our \u201cpolicy.\u201d \n\nI left Reddit from 2010\u20132015. During this time, in addition to rapid user growth, Reddit\u2019s no-removal policy [ossified](https://redditblog.com/2014/09/06/every-man-is-responsible-for-his-own-soul/) and its content policy took [no position on hate](https://web.archive.org/web/20150710230652/https://www.reddit.com/rules/). \n\nWhen I returned in 2015, my top priority was creating a content policy to do two things: deal with hateful communities I had been immediately confronted with (like r/CoonTown, which was explicitly designed to spread racist hate) and provide a clear policy of what\u2019s acceptable on Reddit and what\u2019s not. [We banned that community and others](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/3fx2au/content_policy_update/ctsqobs/) because they were \u201cmaking Reddit worse\u201d but were not clear and direct about their role in sowing hate. We crafted our [2015 policy](https://web.archive.org/web/20150806171017/https://www.reddit.com/help/contentpolicy) around behaviors adjacent to hate that were actionable and objective: violence and harassment, because we struggled to create a definition of hate and racism that we could defend and enforce at our scale. Through continual updates to these policies [2017](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/78p7bz/update_on_sitewide_rules_regarding_violent_content/), [2018](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/863xcj/new_addition_to_sitewide_rules_regarding_the_use/), [2019](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/dbf9nj/changes_to_our_policy_against_bullying_and/), [2020](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditsecurity/comments/emd7yx/updates_to_our_policy_around_impersonation/) (and a broader definition of violence), we have removed thousands of hateful communities. \n\nWhile we dealt with many communities themselves, we still did not provide the clarity\u2014and it showed, both in our enforcement and in confusion about where we stand. In 2018, I confusingly said [racism is not against the rules, but also isn\u2019t welcome on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/3fx2au/content_policy_update/ctsqobs/). This gap between our content policy and our values has eroded our effectiveness in combating hate and racism on Reddit; I accept full responsibility for this.\n\nThis inconsistency has hurt our trust with our users and moderators and has made us slow to respond to problems. This was also true with r/the_donald, a community that relished in exploiting and detracting from the best of Reddit and that is now nearly disintegrated on their own accord. As we looked to our policies, \u201cBreaking Reddit\u201d was not a sufficient explanation for actioning a political subreddit, and I fear we let being technically correct get in the way of doing the right thing. Clearly, we should have quarantined it sooner.\n\nThe majority of our top communities have a rule banning hate and racism, which makes us proud, and is evidence why a [community-led approach is the only way to scale moderation online](https://docs.house.gov/meetings/IF/IF16/20191016/110075/HHRG-116-IF16-Wstate-HuffmanS-20191016.pdf). That said, this is not a rule communities should have to write for themselves and we need to rebalance the burden of enforcement. I also accept responsibility for this. \n\nDespite making significant progress over the years, we have to turn a mirror on ourselves and be willing to do the hard work of making sure we are living up to our values in our product and policies. This is a significant moment. We have a choice: return to the status quo or use this opportunity for change. We at Reddit are opting for the latter, and we will do our very best to be a part of the progress.\n\nI will be sticking around for a while to answer questions as usual, but I also know that our policies and actions will speak louder than our comments.\n\nThanks,\n\nSteve"

However, [the response to this message was swift on Twitter](https://twitter.com/reddit/status/1267643352851247106), where you were rightfully labeled as hypocritical based on your long and well-recorded history of defending racism and white supremacy on this site. \n\nAmong the many responses was this message from former CEO of Reddit, Ellen Pao. \n\n>[I am obligated to call you out: You should have shut down the_donald instead of amplifying it and its hate, racism, and violence. So much of what is happening now lies at your feet. You don't get to say BLM when reddit nurtures and monetizes white supremacy and hate all day long](https://twitter.com/ekp/status/1267689503797342208)\n\nMany others shared links and screenshots of your past statements saying [\u201cOpen racism and slurs are fine to post on Reddit\u201d](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/apr/12/racism-slurs-reddit-post-ceo-steve-huffman).\n\nThe problem of Reddit\u2019s leadership supporting and providing a platform for racist users and hateful communities has long been an issue.  Nearly six years ago, [dozens of subreddits signed the original open letter to the Reddit admins](https://www.reddit.com/r/blackladies/comments/2ejg1b/we_have_a_racist_user_problem_and_reddit_wont/) calling for action.  While [the Reddit admins acknowledged the letter](https://www.reddit.com/r/blackladies/comments/2m9k6p/maybe_its_time_to_repost_the_open_letter_reddit/cm27j8j/) and said it was a high priority to address this issue, extremely little has been done in the intervening years.\n\nOn June 5, you shared this update on /r/Announcements, [Upcoming changes to our content policy, our board, and where we\u2019re going from here](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/gxas21/upcoming_changes_to_our_content_policy_our_board/).  In the post, you stated that there is a need for continued adjustments of Reddit\u2019s content policy to address racism and that this remains a priority.  These continued statements that you hear us, that this is a priority, or that you are working on it are not enough.  It has been five years since your return as CEO and this still remains Reddit\u2019s most glaring problem.\n\nSteve, if you and Reddit genuinely care about the values of standing up to racism and hate, then you need to back it up with real action.  As moderators on this website who have dedicated countless hours to keeping this site running, we call on Reddit to take the following steps:\n\n* **Enact a sitewide policy against racism, slurs, and hatespeech targeted at protected groups.** For too many years, Steve Huffman and the other Admins have stood by and allowed this site to fester with hate in the name of \u201cfree speech.\u201d  It is time to enact a specific and detailed policy that protects the disadvantaged members of our communities from hate based on their sexuality, gender identity, ethnicity, country of origin, religion, or disability.\n\n* **Be proactive in banning hate-based communities**  In the past Reddit has only taken action on hate subreddits when they were featured in the news and risked Reddit\u2019s reputation or when they were documented and featured on /r/AgainstHateSubreddits and other forums.  AHS should not have to be responsible for raising awareness of hate subreddits and reporting them to the admins.  This site should take responsibility for keeping its users safe by banning any remaining subreddits devoted to hate and racism and preventing the creation of hateful subreddits in the future. \n\n* **Be proactive in banning hate users** Reddit needs to not only ban hate subreddits, but must be proactive in banning the moderators of these subreddits and their most active users.  Too often these users have been allowed to stay on this website after numerous sitewide violations, letting them move on to participate in new hate communities and spread their vitriol further across this site.\n\n* **Reddit needs to hire more minorities / women, especially in leadership roles** Reddit needs to hire more women and people of color \u2014 particularly in leadership roles in the company \u2014 to help shift the corporate culture and policies to be more equitable for all.  In addition, Reddit needs to take adequate steps to protect these employees from harassment. \n\n* **Reddit needs to hire more community managers** According to Reddit's [job listings](https://www.redditinc.com/careers) there are dozens of open positions that the company is hiring for, and yet not a single one for Community.  Reddit has enacted numerous policies over the years that have been detrimental to the ability of Reddit\u2019s moderators or the broader Reddit community.  Reddit needs more community managers to build positive relations and engagement with the site\u2019s volunteer moderators.\n\n* **Honor Alexis Ohanian's wishes to have his Reddit Board seat filled with a black candidate** - On June 5, Reddit Co-Founder and Executive Chairman [announced that he would be stepping down](https://twitter.com/alexisohanian/status/1268943036228292608) from his role on Reddit's Board of Directors.  Alexis requested that his position be filled with a black candidate and we ask Reddit to honor that request.  While you have stated your intent to honor that request, we are asking for an announcement to be made on this decision in the next 3 months.  We believe this is not an issue that should be put off for action years down the road.\n\nAt /r/AgainstHateSubreddits, we have laid out the many failures of Steve time and again to stand up to white supremacy on this site [time]( https://www.reddit.com/r/AgainstHateSubreddits/comments/gv7mtn/steve_spez_huffman_is_finally_claiming_that_black/) and [time]( https://www.reddit.com/r/AgainstHateSubreddits/comments/a3q6ck/2018_reddit_review_a_year_of_hate_propaganda_and/) and [time]( https://www.reddit.com/r/AgainstHateSubreddits/comments/84q74p/bbc_calls_out_rthe_donald_for_being_a_thriving/) again.\n\nWith a website with the impact of Reddit on the broader conversations being held in communities around the world, this website needs real leadership and real action.\n\nWe hope that Reddit will not just share empty platitudes \u2014 but will take a meaningful stand against hate, and take these recommendations to heart.\n\nThis letter is co-signed by more than ~~200~~ ~~**300**~~ ~~**350**~~ ~~**430**~~ ~~**550**~~ ~~**650**~~ **800** communities representing ~~well over

I\u2019ll stick around to answer your questions about the report (and other topics) in the comments.**\n\nHi all,\n\nIt\u2019s that time of year again when we share Reddit\u2019s annual transparency report.\n\nWe share this report each year because you have a right to know how user data is being managed by Reddit, and how it\u2019s both shared and not shared with government and non-government parties.\n\nYou\u2019ll find information on content removed from Reddit and requests for user information. This year, we\u2019ve expanded the report to include new data\u2014specifically, a breakdown of content policy removals, content manipulation removals, subreddit removals, and subreddit quarantines.\n\n## By the numbers\n\nSince the [full report](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/transparency-report-2019) is rather long, I\u2019ll call out a few stats below:\n\n**ADMIN REMOVALS**\n\n* In 2019, we removed **\\~53M** pieces of content in total, mostly for spam and content manipulation (e.g. brigading and vote cheating), exclusive of legal/copyright removals, which we track separately.\n* For [Content Policy](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy) violations, we removed\n   * **222k** **pieces of content**,\n   * **55.9k accounts**, and\n   * **21.9k** **subreddits** (**87%** of which were removed for being unmoderated).\n* Additionally, we quarantined **256 subreddits**.\n\n**LEGAL REMOVALS**\n\n* Reddit received **110 requests** from government entities to remove content, of which we complied with **37.3%**.\n* In 2019 we removed about **5x more** content for copyright infringement than in 2018, largely due to copyright notices for adult-entertainment and notices targeting pieces of content that had already been removed.\n\n**REQUESTS FOR USER INFORMATION**\n\n* We received a total of **772 requests** for user account information from law enforcement and government entities.\n   * **366** of these were emergency disclosure requests, mostly from US law enforcement (**68%** of which we complied with).\n   * **406** were non-emergency requests (**73%** of which we complied with); most were US subpoenas.\n   * Reddit received an additional **224 requests** to temporarily preserve certain user account information (**86%** of which we complied with).\n* Note: We carefully review each request for compliance with applicable laws and regulations. If we determine that a request is not legally valid, Reddit will challenge or reject it. (You can read more in our [Privacy Policy](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/privacy-policy) and [Guidelines for Law Enforcement](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/guidelines-for-law-enforcement).)\n\n## While I have your attention...\n\nI\u2019d like to share an update about our thinking around quarantined communities.\n\nWhen we [expanded our quarantine policy](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/9jf8nh/revamping_the_quarantine_function/), we created an appeals process for sanctioned communities. One of the goals was to \u201cforce subscribers to reconsider their behavior and incentivize moderators to make changes.\u201d While the policy attempted to hold moderators more accountable for enforcing healthier rules and norms, it didn\u2019t address the role that each member plays in the health of their community.\n\nToday, we\u2019re making an update to address this gap: Users who consistently upvote policy-breaking content within quarantined communities will receive automated warnings, followed by further consequences like a temporary or permanent suspension. We hope this will encourage healthier behavior across these communities.\n\n## If you\u2019ve read this far\n\nIn addition to this report, we share news throughout the year from teams across Reddit, and if you like posts about what we\u2019re doing, you can stay up to date and talk to our teams in r/RedditSecurity, r/ModNews, r/redditmobile, and r/changelog.\n\n**As usual, I\u2019ll be sticking around to answer your questions in the comments. AMA.**\n\nUpdate: I'm off for now. Thanks for questions, everyone."

            "Body": "In the past couple of weeks, Reddit has been mentioned as one of the platforms used to promote Russian propaganda. As it\u2019s an ongoing investigation, we have been relatively quiet on the topic publicly, which I know can be frustrating. While transparency is important, we also want to be careful to not tip our hand too much while we are investigating. We take the integrity of Reddit extremely seriously, both as the stewards of the site and as Americans.\n\nGiven the recent news, we\u2019d like to share some of what we\u2019ve learned:\n\nWhen it comes to Russian influence on Reddit, there are three broad areas to discuss: ads, direct propaganda from Russians, indirect propaganda promoted by our users.\n\nOn the first topic, ads, there is not much to share. We don\u2019t see a lot of ads from Russia, either before or after the 2016 election, and what we do see are mostly ads promoting spam and ICOs.  Presently, ads from Russia are blocked entirely, and all ads on Reddit are reviewed by humans. Moreover, our [ad policies](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/advertising/policy-and-guidelines/reddit-advertising-policy) prohibit content that depicts intolerant or overly contentious political or cultural views.\n\nAs for direct propaganda, that is, content from accounts we suspect are of Russian origin or content linking directly to known propaganda domains, we are doing our best to identify and remove it. We have found and removed a few hundred accounts, and of course, every account we find expands our search a little more. The vast majority of suspicious accounts we have found in the past months were banned back in 2015\u20132016 through our enhanced efforts to prevent abuse of the site generally.\n\nThe final case, indirect propaganda, is the most complex. For example, the Twitter account @TEN\\_GOP is now known to be a Russian agent. @TEN\\_GOP\u2019s Tweets were amplified by thousands of Reddit users, and sadly, from everything we can tell, these users are mostly American, and appear to be unwittingly promoting Russian propaganda. I believe the biggest risk we face as Americans is our own ability to discern reality from nonsense, and this is a burden we all bear.\n\nI wish there was a solution as simple as banning all propaganda, but it\u2019s not that easy. Between truth and fiction are a thousand shades of grey. It\u2019s up to all of us\u2014Redditors, citizens, journalists\u2014to work through these issues. It\u2019s somewhat ironic, but I actually believe what we\u2019re going through right now will actually reinvigorate Americans to be more vigilant, hold ourselves to higher standards of discourse, and fight back against propaganda, whether foreign or not.\n\nThank you for reading. While I know it\u2019s frustrating that we don\u2019t share everything we know publicly, I want to reiterate that we take these matters very seriously, and we are cooperating with congressional inquiries. We are growing more sophisticated by the day, and we remain open to suggestions and feedback for how we can improve."
