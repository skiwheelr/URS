# Reddit Scraper for Penetration Testing posts

This is a Reddit scraper I created using the Reddit API. It is designed specifically to scrape for information within the following subreddits:
 - Pentesting
 - AskNetSec
 - HowToHack
 - netsec
 - hacking
 - netsecstudents
 - raspberry_pi
 - homelab
 - Kalilinux
 - Hacking_Tutorials
 - pentest

You can choose which category of posts to scrape each subreddit as well as how many results are returned. These options include:
 - Hot
 - New
 - Controversial
 - Top
 - Rising
 - Search
   
Users also have the option to search each subreddit for keywords; however, all search results are returned and the number of results the user specifically wants is disregarded.
   
This program can be easily modified to scrape any subreddit(s). All you have to do is change the list of subreddits to search on line 21 to the subreddits you'd like to scrape.

Enjoy!
